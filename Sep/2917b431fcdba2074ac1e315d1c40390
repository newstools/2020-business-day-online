 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned Friday’s fresh attack on the convoy of Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, by insurgents resulting in the killing of security operatives attached to the governor. The PDP said the repeated attack on the governor as well as the rising wave of terrorist attacks reinforced fear over security compromises and lapses. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said the situation had necessitated the need to immediately sack the service chiefs and replace them. The statement said, “This is particularly with Governor Zulum’s insistence that the security architecture in the North East axis is being compromised. “Our party is alarmed by the frightening situation where insurgents now have the temerity of repeated attacks on the armed convoy of a state governor, which highlights the nightmare being witnessed by ordinary compatriots, as soft targets, in various troubled areas across our dear nation.” “The PDP restates our call to President Muhammadu Buhari to heed the call by well-meaning Nigerians, including the two chambers of the National Assembly, to immediately rejig the nation’s security apparatchik by replacing his service chiefs with fresh hands to effectively confront the security challenges facing our nation. “Our party commiserates with Governor Zulum as well as the families of the victims of these incessant attacks and urged the governor not to be deterred. “The PDP also salutes the gallantry of our troops fighting in the fronts despite all odds and urged Nigerians to remain prayerful and alert at this trying time.”
