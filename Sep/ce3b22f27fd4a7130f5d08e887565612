 The Abdulraziz Yari faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara has indicated the readiness to reconcile with the former Senator, Kabiru Marafa faction to make the party formidable ahead of 2023 elections. The Yari and Marafa factions of the APC have being at daggers drawn since last year, a development which culminated into the sacking of all APC candidates that won the Governorship, National and State Assemblies elections in the 2019 polls. But addressing journalists on Tuesday at APC National Secretariat in Abuja, the former Governor of the State, Yari whose Senate election was also squashed as a result of the crisis said his faction was ready for reconciliation. He however, decried the romance of Marafa with the PDP administration of Governor Bello Matawalle in Zamfara which has appointed the former Senator’s allies into the State Executive Council. “Reconciliation to some extent needs results but every reconciliation that eventually mars the prospects of the party is not on point. Reconciliation has some many definitions. We are ready to reconcile with everyone. But the situation where you are going to reconcile with somebody who already has members in the Government of the State is not good. He has Secretary to the State Government, he has Commissioners, he has everyone there. “But if everyone is ready for reconciliation we will know what is there because we have being doing this game since 1999 and by God’s grace we have been seeing the feature of party come 2023. We are ready for reconciliation and we are supporting the Acting Chairman for any reconciliation, ranging from Zamafara State to anywhere. We want our party to deliver. “I am going slow but steady and we are doing all of this. We have done it before and it is a trust since 1999, that is what is reposed on us. We make it in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, 100% APC”, he stated.
