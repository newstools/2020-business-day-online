 Ahead of the September 19 governorship election in Edo State, the Yoruba Community in the state has pledged to vote en masse for the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, to enable the governor to continue with his multi-sectoral reforms. Abiodun Adewale, leader of the Yoruba Community in Edo State, who made the pledge on Friday while speaking to journalists in Benin City, the state capital, said, “We are standing with Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Rt. Hon. Philip Shaibu, who have made Edo State another home for Yoruba businessmen and women.” SEE ALSO: Christian leaders in Edo endorse Obaseki, Shaibu for second term He said the Obaseki-led administration has made it easy for the Yoruba Community to do their businesses in Edo. “Nobody harasses you anymore for illegal and burdensome levies. Ring Road, Lagos Street and other places where many Yoruba people ply their trade have been revamped, so we will all vote for Obaseki come September 19. “Yoruba people – lecturers, media practitioners, taxi and bus drivers, printers, tailors, hawkers of traditional medicine or agbo, farmers, those selling along Lagos Street and every other Yoruba person in Edo State – should vote for Obaseki and the PDP,” he urged.
