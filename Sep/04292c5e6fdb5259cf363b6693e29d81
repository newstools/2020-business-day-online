 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Thursday promised that it would work on the lapses observed in the just concluded Edo State governorship election with a view to improving on its performance in the October 10 governorship election in Ondo state. The INEC chairman, Mammud Yakubu, made the promise in Akure, during interaction with newsmen on the ahead governorship poll at the state headquarters of the commission. The INEC boss explained that the interaction was important because the commission wanted to know about the observations of the stakeholders both in Edo election and the pre-election happenings in Ondo State that could help the commission in its preparation for the election. Yakubu, therefore, reassured Nigerians that the commission would remain neutral in the conduct of the October 10 Ondo State gubernatorial election. According to him, the commission has delivered all non sensitive materials for the election, while the all sensitive materials would arrive at Central Bank of Nigeria in Akure on Monday where it would be distributed to all its branches. He assured that all the 3009 polling units in the state, including the riverine area, would be adequately supplied with all necessary election materials and voting would commence at the appropriate time. The professor also assured the people of the state that the commission had got over the challenges created by the fire outbreak that razed over 5000 smart card readers in the Akure office. “We have fully recovered from the fire incident. We are purging and configuring the smart card readers ready for the election. They were moped up from Oyo. “We are moving the Z-Pad from Edo to Ondo State for the 3009 polling units,” the INEC boss said. Yakubu, also charged all journalists covering the election to report to the commission any malpractice noticed through its media platform.
