 Bode George, a former deputy national chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), has warned that the nation was disintegrating and in a state of hopelessness under the current administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari. George warned that the gulf between the ethnic nationalities in the country is widening, saying that this may be a prelude to a greater disaster. The PDP chieftain stated this Thursday while counselling PDP aspirants in the forthcoming Lagos-east senatorial and Kosofe 2 state byelections, stressing that no Nigerian today can say that he is happy with what is going on in the country. George insisted that the APC has failed woefully; while adding that contrary to the position held by Mamman Daura, zoning was vital for the peace, growth and the progress of the nation.

It was a forced union for the benefit of the economic business of the British people. That’s all. “Since then we have been trying to stabilise, manage ourselves all along. And take a country like Switzerland, three major tribes in Switzerland, the French, the Italians and the Germans. “They rotate the leadership of their country; is that novel to Nigeria? Turn by turn Nigeria Ltd, turn by turn Switzerland Ltd. Have you ever heard of any crisis in that country? “So what is so difficult about this issue of zoning? We thank God today there is no part of this country that would not have some academic, brilliant people in every corner of Nigeria,” he said. According to him, “The system we are running today is very defective. I have seen both sides, I have been in the military. Each time I look at it, and I remember it, it’s like I see it’s a military government”.
