 Nasarawa State government is planning to build a big market that would enable farmers bring their agricultural produce for sale. The state Commissioner for Agriculture and Water Resources, Allanana Otaki, disclosed this when members of the Correspondents’ Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalist (NUJ), Nasarawa State chapter, visited him in his office in Lafia. Otaki said government was not comfortable the way agricultural produce are sold without commensurate value by buyers, hence the market to regulate sales of commodities.

I am trying my best to elevate Nasarawa State agriculture beyond what I came and met,” Otaki said. “I also met one traditional ruler in the state whom we toured all his farms, and what I saw was very marvellous, because the traditional ruler alone can supply one-quarter of his fish to FCT and other products. That farm alone can feed one-quarter of Nasarawa State,” he said.
