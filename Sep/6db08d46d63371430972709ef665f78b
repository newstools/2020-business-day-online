 Yekini Idiaye, the former deputy speaker, Edo State House of Assembly, Wednesday expressed optimism that the All Progressives Congress (APC), will win the Saturday Governorship election in the State . Idiaye, member representing Akoko-Edo I, made the remarks while speaking with journalists on the chances of APC in the election. The immediate former Deputy Speaker, was impeached after endorsing the All Progressives Congress governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-lyamu. He said the APC would win in his constituency because there are no tangible projects constructed by the state in the last four years in his constituency. “There was little or nothing to show to the people of Akoko-Edo that should warrant voting for governor Godwin Obaseki”, he said. He however, added that he refused to defect to PDP as a result of the outcome of his consultations with his constituency. Idiaye, who explained that politics was all about the people and not selfish interest, added that with the dictates of the constitution, it was improper for an elected member to defect to another political party while still serving the mandate given to him by the electorate. While advising the electorate to come out en-masse to vote for APC , he expressed confident that the election would be devoid of violence following deployment of security officers. The lawmaker who denied collecting N40 million to remain in APC, described the allegation as politics taken too far.
