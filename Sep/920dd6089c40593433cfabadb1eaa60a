 Special Adviser to Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is stirring controversy so that the authorities will shift the September 19 gubernatorial election in the state. In a statement he issued in Benin City, the state capital, on Sunday, Osagie said the state is peaceful and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is committed to enduring peace before, during and after the poll. “APC leaders and gubernatorial candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, are agitated because they are not ready for the election. They are convinced that they do not stand any chance in the forthcoming election,” Osagie said. “They are behaving like some unserious and misguided university students who do not read, and when faced with examinations, they engage in anti-cult fights few weeks to the examination, so that the school authority will shift the examination,” he said. He emphasised that “Edo State is peaceful as people are going about their businesses peacefully”, urging the APC candidate and his handlers to concentrate on their campaign.
