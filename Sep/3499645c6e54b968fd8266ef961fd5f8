 With less than two days to the governorship election in Edo State, a group, Strategic Outreach Support (SOS), has thrown its weight behind the reelection of Governor Godwin Obaseki, swelling the support base of the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The non-governmental organisation also produced and donated over 2,000 face masks to the state government to be made available to voters on election day to enable them access the polling booths in accordance with the directive of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). President of the group, Uzoma Ehikwe, who spoke to journalists in Benin City after delivering the items to the office of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, urged eligible voters to come out en masse on Saturday to vote for the PDP to enable the governor consolidate on the successes recorded in the first term.
