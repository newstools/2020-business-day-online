 Oyo State chapter of Zenith Labour Party ( ZLP) on Tuesday expressed worry over Governor Seyi Makinde’s alleged failure to fulfil the promises made to the party a few days to the 2019 gubernatorial election. ZLP is one of the political parties that worked for the success of Makinde who contested on the platform of People’s Democratic Party (PDP). ZLP candidate, Sharafadeen Alli, African Democratic Congress (ADC) gubernatorial candidate, Olufemi Lanlehin and Social Democratic Party ( SDP) Bolaji Ayorinde (SAN) and some politicians were persuaded by a former governor of the state, Senator Rashidi Ladoja and asked to jettison their ambitions and support Makinde who defeated the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Adebayo Adelabu in the March 9, 2019 election.

Wole Abisoye, ZLP chairman, reacting insisted that Makinde did not disappoint the party, but only disappointed himself by not honouring the agreements. Abisoye, who addressed party members at Oyo South Senatorial meeting of the party held in Ibadan on Tuesday, however, vowed that the party is ready to unseat Makinde in 2023. The ZLP Chairman, while speaking at the meeting attended by ZLP gubernatorial candidate in 2019, Sharafadeen Alli; ZLP Senatorial candidate for Oyo South in 2019, Remi Olajide; ZLP candidate for Ido/ Ibarapa East Federal constituency, Bimbo Adepoju, and state women leader, Bola Alonge, maintained that the party has a solid structure to defeat Makinde in 2023.
