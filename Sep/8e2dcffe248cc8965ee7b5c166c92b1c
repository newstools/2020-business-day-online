 Governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have called on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to immediately provide more logistical support to security agencies deployed to Borno State to ensure speedy return to normal life in the State and the whole of North East. The APC Governors made the call while reacting to the Saturday’s attacks on the convoys of the Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum and the Committee on Baga reconstruction along Maiduguri/Baga Road of Borno State. The Governors under the umbrella of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) in statement on Sunday signed by Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku-Bagudu re-affirmed commitment to support security agencies to end all activities of Boko Haram in all parts of Nigeria. “As Progressive Governors, we are saddened by this dastardly attack, which has resulted in the unfortunate death of precious lives of security personnel and innocent citizens. “We join our brother, Governor Zulum, our leaders in Borno State and all Nigerians to pray for the repose of the souls of all those who lost their lives. In this painful period, Nigerians should be strengthened by the determination of Governor Zulum to expedite peace building process in Borno State and indeed the whole of North East. “All Nigerians should rise in support of the laudable initiatives of Borno State Government to return citizens in the State back to normal life. We must rise in support of the people and government of Borno State to end all activities of Boko Haram insurgents, which promote trade and tax administration that fund their heinous activities. “Clearly, the strategies and tactics currently adopted by Borno State and security agencies are very effective and the attack of Saturday, September 26, 2020 on the two convoys by the Boko Haram insurgents is to distract the government from ensuring that life return to normal in Borno State”, the statement read in parts.
