 The Governor Mai-Mala Buni-led All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee has upturned the suspension of the Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, by the State Executive Committee of the party in Ekiti. The Ekiti State Executive of APC had earlier on Friday announced the suspension of Fayemi over what it called “his numerous anti-party activities, especially his role in the recently concluded governorship election in Edo State”. But reacting to this, the APC national leadership said the action of the Ekiti APC was a nullity. The statement signed by Yekini Nabena, APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, and titled “Disclaimer: Governor Kayode Fayemi, Other Purported ‘Suspensions’ a Nullity – APC”, said, “The attention of the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to a purported and widely-reported “suspension” of the Governor of Ekiti State, H.E. Kayode Fayemi as well as an earlier reported “indefinite suspension” of some other party members in the state.

We strongly advise all members to adhere to our Party constitution. Governor Kayode Fayemi remains the leader of the party in Ekiti State. “In line with the mandate of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee and the President’s admonition to party members to ensure and support ongoing amicable and rancour-free settlement of internal party disputes, we call on our esteemed party members and leaders in Ekiti State to be duly guided. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Architect Paul Omotosho-chaired APC Ekiti State Working Committee is the authentic, valid and duly recognised Executive as no factions or divisions exist in the State Chapter.”
