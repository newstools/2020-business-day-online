 The former Edo State Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Godwin Erhahon on Monday said the party lost the governorship election because of Adams Oshiomhole’s overbearing political influence on Benin people. Erhahon, opined that those who attempted to resist the former Edo State governor, Adams Oshiomhole’s imposition of the governor on the party in 2016 felt it would be foolish of them to allow the same former national chairman of the party to use them to remove the same governor who he had positively marketed. While expressing gratitude to God for the peaceful election, he however, congratulated the State Governor Godwin Obaseki on his victory and the APC governorship candidate Osagie Ize_Iyamu for his gallant efforts. “I am very proud of the governor for winning his unit and ward. I have no regrets working against the Governor in the election because I believe he can’t change from his style of governance. “He will remain a hater of mankind. The challenges before APC is to ensure that Comrade Oshiomhole doesn’t interfere in the choice of party officials in the forthcoming Congress, otherwise he will overload the party with sycophants, minions and incompetent leadership”, he added.
