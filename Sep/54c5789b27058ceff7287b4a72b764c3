 As the date for the Ondo State gubernatorial election draws closer, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has described his predecessor and former governor Olusegun Mimiko as one of the main enemies standing against his re-election bid on October 10. Governor Akeredolu stated while featuring live on the Channels TV popular programme, ‘Politics Today’ which was monitored by our correspondent. Recall that the former governor Mimiko, at the weekend in Ile-Oluji, Ile-Oluji/Okeigbo Local Government Area of the state during the campaign tour of Agboola Ajayi, described his friend and successor in office, Akeredolu, as a disappointment to the good people of the state, saying APC and Akeredolu run anti-people government in the state. But Akeredolu, while replying, described Mimiko as a “bogus enemy (sic)”, saying it is better for both of them to separate and go on their separate ways. The governor, who is seeking re-election, alleged that Mimiko has politically betrayed him as a friend. Akeredolu said: “I took him (Mimiko) as a friend but I doubt if truly he is my friend. I am not somebody that hides feelings. Reference to him as my friend may probably not be right. To me, he is a bogus enemy and I think he remains so I think for life. “It is better for us to separate and go our ways because with a friend like him, you don’t need an enemy, so you don’t play this high level of betrayal in politics. “For me, I am not interested in his own politics, if he thinks he is playing politics, he is fooling himself but for me am not human and I can tell you today that both of them, former Chief Judge of Ondo State, Sehinde Kumuyi and Mimiko are my bogus enemies and they will remain forever. I know God will forgive me, I know that am going to survive it and they will regret the action for life.”
