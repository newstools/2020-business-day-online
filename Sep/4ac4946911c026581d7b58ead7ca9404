 Ekiti state governor, Kayode Fayemi has been suspended by his State Executive Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) due “his numerous anti-party activities, especially his role in the recently concluded governorship election in Edo State.” According to a statement released by the party on Friday, the party claimed that Gov Fayemi hosted People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain Femi Fani- Kayode in the government house in Ado Ekiti in the run-up to the Edo elections and also played a role in the gubernatorial election in Oyo State where he supported the PDP candidate to defeat the APC candidate. “Kayode Fayemi, the Executive Governor of Ekiti State is hereby suspended from the Party in view of his numerous anti-party activities especially his role in the recently concluded governorship election in Edo State which is contrary to the provisions of Article 21 (A) (ii) of the APC Constitution,” a statement signed by Ekiti State APC State Executive Committee led by Tony Adeniyi, a Senator of Ekiti South Senatorial District between 2011 to 2015. The accusation against Governor Fayemi, the Nigerian Governors Forum chairperson, is coming days after some party stakeholders in Ekiti State alleged that he supported Godwin Obaseki, the candidate of the PDP, in the just-concluded Edo State elections.
