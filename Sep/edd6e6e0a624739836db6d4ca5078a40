 Former governor of Delta State, Emmanuel Uduaghan, on Monday officially returned to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Chairman of PDP Abigborodo Ward 6, Kingsley Ogio, handed Uduaghan his party card symbolizing his full re-entry into the PDP. Uduaghan, a former chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, said he briefly stepped out of PDP “to find out what is happening on the other side”. “This is my ward, ward 6. I came here to formalize my full re-entry into PDP because the ward is the strongest structure in any political party. I just stepped out to find out what is happening on the other side. Today, I have come to pick up my card that I left behind while I was going,” he said.

He was also a Commissioner for Health and later Secretary to the State Government under the administration of former Governor James Ibori. He had left the PDP for the APC on August 29, 2018, in the build-up to the 2019 general elections, and contested the Delta South Senatorial District ticket but lost to James Manager of the PDP. “I want to promise you that collectively we shall be sitting together as often as possible to articulate our issues,” he said. He urged Deltans to support the administration of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to move the state forward, noting that though the country is hard, the state government is doing its best in spite of drop in crude oil prices. “I want to thank the governor who has been piloting the affairs of the state,” Uduaghan said.
