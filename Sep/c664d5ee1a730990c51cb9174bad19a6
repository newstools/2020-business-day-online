 The Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, on their victory in the September 19 gubernatorial election in the state. State Chairman of the APC in Edo State, Anselm Ojezua, who signed the congratulatory message issued in Benin City, the Edo State capital, said, “We join President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Caretaker Committee of our great party to congratulate Governor Godwin Obaseki and his Deputy Rt. Hon. Philip Shaibu on their victory at the just-concluded governorship election in Edo State.” Ojezua noted that the election has been generally acclaimed to be peaceful, orderly and transparent and that the people of Edo State have made their choice in a very clear and unambiguous manner. The APC state chairman, however, explained that the party’s loss at the poll “stems from the needless and avoidable crisis foisted on the party by a selfish, insensitive, arrogant and irresponsible leadership”.
