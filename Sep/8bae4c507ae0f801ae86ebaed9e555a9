 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it would continue to use members of National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) for the conduct of elections in the country because corps members had contributed enormously to recent success and improvement in the overall conduct of elections in Nigeria. Sam Olumekun, Lagos Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), stated this Thursday when the Lagos State National Youth Service management led by its new coordinator, Edwin Chinedu Mega paid a courtesy visit to the Lagos office of the commission. In a statement yesterday by the Commission’s Lagos Public Relations Officer (PRO), Femi Akinbiyi, Olumekun thanked the coordinator for the visit and maintained that the turning point of conduct of elections in this country for good was when the NYSC was introduced into the conduct of elections in Nigeria.
