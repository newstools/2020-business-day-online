Salihu Ibrahim, Sokoto State chairman of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), told journalists in an interview on the sidelines that 80 percent of his members were affected by the flood. He thanked Egbaran for the visit which he described as the first of its kind ever paid to them by their insurance companies. Abubakar Danfuloti Tambuwal, the state chairman of Maize Farmers Association, also said the association has about 3,000 members but those that were not affected by the flood would not be up to 350. “All our farmers along the riverine areas were affected,” he said.
