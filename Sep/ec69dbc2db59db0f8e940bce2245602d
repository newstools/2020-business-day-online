 The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Monday inaugurated two Committees on the distribution of grains and sales of fertilisers and other agrochemical inputs in the Territory. The FCT Minister of State, Ramatu Aliyu while inaugurating the Committees in Abuja, said the move was in fulfillment of the Administration’s desire to ensure governance serves the people and to address food security in the nation’s capital. The Minister who was represented by her Senior Special Assistant on Administration and Strategy, Muhammad Usman said the terms of reference of the Committees include: “to determine available stock and work out modalities for the sales, and to arrange for the flag-off and subsequent sales of the fertilizers, pesticides, and agrochemicals”. Aliyu charged members of the Committees to work diligently to ensure that the exercise meets its objective, by ensuring that the grains are released from warehouses and made available to the residents of the Territory in a manner that is free, fair, and transparent. She said: “As you are aware, it is an annual ritual practice, that the Administration buys off excess harvest from our farmers, therefore, giving them value for their efforts and labour at the end of the season. And before the new harvest, when prices naturally on the increase because of reducing supply in the market, the Administration releases the buffer stocks to ensure that prices are regulated if not drastically lowered, for the benefit of the residents of the Territory”. Responding, Abdul Agbade Chairman of the Committee on grains distribution, and Abubakar Ibrahim, Chairman of the Committee on fertilizers and other agrochemicals sales pledged their willingness to deliver on their mandates.
