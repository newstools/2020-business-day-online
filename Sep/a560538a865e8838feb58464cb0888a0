 Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, has said that the state governor is not behind the alleged arrest of members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Osagie said the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, has nothing to do with the alleged arrest of APC members in the state.

The police are controlled by the Inspector General of Police in Abuja and it is wrong for the APC to accuse the Edo State governor, who is still relishing the victory given to him by Edo voters in the September 19 gubernatorial election, of ordering the arrest of its members,” he said.
