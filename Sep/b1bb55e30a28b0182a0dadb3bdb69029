 Nigeria’s stock market dips further by 0.33 percent (or N44billion) as investors continued to take profit on banking stocks, no thanks to GTBank, Zenith and Union Bank equity holders. Crude oil prices slumped to their lowest level in more than two months, under pressure from a stalling recovery in demand and planned production expansions by OPEC that threaten to add to an existing glut of crude. Brent-crude futures dropped 5.4percent to $39.73 a barrel, the first time the international benchmark has fallen below $40 in more than two months. Futures tied to West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, tumbled 8percent to $36.58 a barrel, their lowest price since mid-June. The record dip seen on Tuesday September 8 at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has increased the market’s negative return year-to-date (YtD) to -5.01percent. Also, the positive returns seen month-to-date (MtD) has decreased to 0.67percent. Investors lost N44billion at the close of trading session on the Nigerian Bourse.
