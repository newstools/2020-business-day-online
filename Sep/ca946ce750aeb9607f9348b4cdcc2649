 With less than two days to the governorship election in Edo State, a group, Strategic Outreach Support (SOS), has thrown its weight behind the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki, swelling the support base of the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The non-governmental organisation also produced and donated over 2,000 facemasks to the state government to be made available to voters on election day, to enable them access the polling booths in accordance with the directive of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). President of the group, Uzoma Ehikwe, who spoke with journalists in Benin City after delivering the items to the office of the special adviser to the governor on media and communication strategy, urged eligible voters to come out en masse on Saturday to vote for the PDP to enable the governor consolidate on the successes recorded in the first term. Commending the governor’s achievements across all sectors in the state, Ehikwe noted: “As a concerned group interested in good governance and development of Edo State, we acknowledge the developmental strides recorded by the Obaseki-led administration and want continuity of the governor’s people-centric governance; his laudable projects are there for everyone to see. “From the State Secretariat Complex and the 55MW CCETC-Ossiomo Power Plant, which have been completed and ready for use, to the 5500bpd Edo Modular Refinery, the Benin Enterprise and Industrial Park, among other legacy projects, the governor has continued to earn the love and support of majority of Edo people. “Today, we are donating over 2,000 face masks to the government, to be distributed to voters to enable them access their polling booths on election day so as to vote massively for the PDP to ensure the governor’s victory. “We are very sure that Edo people will come out en masse to re-elect the governor because they want this government to continue with the ongoing developmental projects and reforms which have transformed the state into a safe haven for investors.”
