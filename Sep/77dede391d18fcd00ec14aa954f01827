 Governor of Edo State and candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the September 19 governorship election in the state, has promised to tackle the unemployment situation in the state by encouraging private sector investment in the state if elected for second a term. Obaseki was speaking Sunday night in the Channels Television-organised governorship debate, promising to create 157,000 jobs for indigenes of the state. He said his administration has opened up the airport in the state which was attracting about eight flights daily to the Benin airport. “I will create 2,000 jobs in the next four years. We hope to create 157,000 jobs and creating an enabling environment for the private sector,” Obaseki said. “We are not competing with the private sector but aim to open up the state. Since we came on board, we have opened up the Benin airport, now we have about eight flights to Benin airport daily,” he said. On his part, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), promised to revitalise the security architecture in Edo State and increase funding to them to enable creation of 10,000 jobs in the sector for indigenes of the state. He lamented the poor state of security in the state, stressing that if elected, his administration would give it a priority.
