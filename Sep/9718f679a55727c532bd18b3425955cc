From Law to Fashion: During a chat with journalist, she tells about her interest in fashion from day one
”I studied law and graduated with a second class upper but even before I got into the university, I had always been interested in fashion. In fact, I started out as a model by playfully modelling and styling myself in outfits by the brands I love and taking pictures in them as a hobby. I would post these pictures online and tag my favourite designer whose outfit I was wearing and this was in the early days of social media so somehow one day I got a message from EGO UK and pulled off that gig more brands came and we kept it going on from there. It was pretty encouraging to see that I could make money from something I had fun doing” Zori did not leave things at modeling and running social media influencer campaigns for international and local brands, she ventured to expand her enterprise. That year, Zori started a fashion and lifestyle blog called “Glam n Glimmer”.
