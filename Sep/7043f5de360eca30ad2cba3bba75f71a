 The All Progressives Congress ( APC) Women Network for Buhari, Kwara North Zone on Tuesday raised the alarm over what it described as toxic propaganda and character assassination targeted at denigrating the reputation of Aishat Ahman Pategi, former Kwara State commissioner for special duties who resigned last week. The group warned that any attack on her would be considered as an affront on their people and such would attract their wrath. A release signed by Hadiza Abubakar, zonal coordinator of APC Women Network for Buhari, Kwara North Chapter reads: “We the APC Women Network for Buhari, Kwara North Zone wish to extol the exceptional courage exhibited by one of our members and leader in Patigi Local Government Area, Hajia Aisha Ahman Pategi, the former commissioner for special duties, who showed brave spirit by voluntarily resigning from a government which seems to be losing the goodwill of Kwara people particularly amongst the women constituency in the state.
