 On Tuesday September 15, the stock market of Africa’s largest economy was unable to sustain previous day’s gains, no thanks to investors in oil & gas counters. More investors offered shares of Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc which affected the pricing. Seplat led the losers table after moving from N390 to N385, down by N5 or 1.28percent. Red Star Express Plc share price also dipped, from N3.75 to N3.52, losing 23kobo or 6.13percent. Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc decreased from N12.05 to N11.9, losing 15kobo or 1.24percent. Oando Plc share price was also down from N2.38 to N2.25, losing 13kobo or 5.46percent; while NPF Microfinance Bank Plc dipped from N1.38 to N1.25, down by 13kobo or 9.42percent. The negative sentiment seen around oil & gas stocks on the Nigerian Bourse –NSE Oil & Gas Index (-1.16percent) – comes despite that crude oil prices rose on Tuesday, but forecasts of a slower than expected recovery in global fuel demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic still weighed.
