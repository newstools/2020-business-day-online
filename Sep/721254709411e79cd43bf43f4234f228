 Eziobe Traditional Council of Igarra, Akoko Edo Local Government Area of Edo State, on Sunday donated the sum of N2 million to the All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign council. Joseph Mayaki Akpeji, the Otu of Igarra and head of the Eziobe Traditional Council, presented the cheque to the party’s governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, in Benin City, the state capital. At the presentation of the cheque, Akpeji said they had promised to assist the party with N1million but, however, decided to increase the money due to the enormous finances required to drive a successful governorship campaign. Akpeji, represented by the Afekhai of Igarra, Attagun Illeya, praised the integrity and resourcefulness of the APC governorship candidate, saying the traditional council was encouraged to support the APC candidate because they believe he would fulfill his electoral promises. They also assured him of victory at the polls, noting that they have never supported an aspiration that failed. Receiving the cheque, the APC governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, said the kind gesture was a demonstration that Edo people have accepted and keyed into the party’s vision and mission to reposition the state. He said the gesture has further committed him to speedily revamp the moribund Ojirami Dam, attract investors to explore vast deposits of natural resources, provide other social amenities and address security challenges in the area. The APC governorship candidate assured the donors that the party would put the money into judicious use. Other prominent members of the delegation at the presentation were Jude Gadimoh, Sani Collins Ojo, Ukana Andrew, Bashiru Ozi-Yakubu, and Lasisi Amunega.
