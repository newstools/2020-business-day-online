 The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila on Tuesday said all policies, including legislative framework, must be put in place to give qualitative education to Nigerian children to reduce the number of out-of-school children. According to the Speaker, Nigerian children must be given all the necessary care and attention, especially quality education, that they require to attain their goals in life. Gbajabiamila, who said he always identifies with Nigerian children wherever they are, noted that in support of the age-long maxim that children are the leaders of tomorrow, concerted efforts must be done by all well-meaning Nigerians to achieve a better tomorrow for Nigerian children. Gbajabiamila while celebrating with Nigerian children as they commemorate  the 2020 edition of Children’s Day assured that he would always champion the cause of the Nigerian children both in Parliament and outside. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker said the Nigerian children have a lot of potential that must be carefully harnessed through good education and training. The Nigeria’s number four citizen said the country cannot set aside May 27 every year to celebrate her children without taking decisive action to better their lives. He assured that the House of Representatives under him would stop at nothing in supporting any policy that would promote the rights of the Nigerian child, including their inalienable right to a good education. The Speaker also called on governments at all levels to come up with programmes and policies that would promote the rights and education of the children. Gbajabiamila equally called on parents to be responsible and responsive in taking good care and training of their children so that the country would be better for it in future.
