 Mara Phones said it has donated 10,000 face masks to the Nigerian government as part of its commitment to help limit the spread of the virus and ease the economic impact and hardships faced by individuals. The company said despite the pandemic, it is moving ahead with its plans to build a world-class factory in Nigeria that will manufacture high-quality and affordable smartphones. The plan to build the factory was announced in 2019 at the Africa Investment Forum (AIF). The factory which will cost $100 million to complete is expected to generate over 2,000 direct and high-skilled jobs and contribute to the transfer fo technology and high-tech skills in Nigeria while aiding in the creation and sustenance of a large ecosystem of high-tech companies. The smartphone brand headquartered in Kigali, Rwanda, began to manufacture its first smartphones from a South African plant in 2018. However, the company says its Rwanda facility is the first to fully manufacture smartphones – the Mara X and Mara Z – 100 percent locally in Africa different from product assembly as obtainable at other phone factories across the continent. All components of the products, including the chips are locally sourced, according to the company. Apart from masks donation, Mara said it also offering to significantly subsidise smartphones for businesses and individuals looking to assist governments in connecting frontline workers during COVID-19. “This subsidy will offer individuals or businesses an opportunity to contribute and participate in containing and participate in the spread of this virus by providing frontline workers with a smartphone,” the company said in a statement sent to BusinessDay.
