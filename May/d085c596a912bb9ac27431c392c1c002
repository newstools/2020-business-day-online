 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is still by far the world’s richest person and his net worth has grown by 34 per cent on average over the last five years, said the study by Comparisun, a company which helps organisations compare different business products. Comparisun analysed historical valuations of world’s richest companies and individuals in an attempt to predict when they’ll join the trillion dollar club. Mark Zuckerberg and Mukesh Ambani Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could gain trillionaire status almost a decade later than Bezos. But Zuckerberg’s current rate growth would see him worth $1 trillion, when he will be just 51 years old, said the study. India’s Reliance Industries Limited CEO, Mukesh Ambani could become a trillionaire in 2033 when he will be aged 75, according to the research which said that Chinese real estate tycoon Xu Jiayin will follow Bezos to become the second trillionaire in the world in 2027. Alibaba’s Jack Ma Alibaba’s Jack Ma could become a trillionaire in 2030 when he will be aged 65. Of the 25 individuals the company analysed, only eleven realistically have a chance of becoming a trillionaire during their lifetime, based on their recent rate of wealth growth.  The other individuals in the list are Ma Huateng, Chairman and CEO of Tencent Holdings; Bernard Arnault, CEO of Moet Hennessy parent LVMH; former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer; Dell Technologies Founder Michael Dell; and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Methodology Comparisun analysed the market capitalization of the 25 highest valued companies on the New York Stock Exchange according to Macrotrends, as well as the net worth of the richest 25 people in the world, according to Forbes, in both cases taking the last five years of data. For both the studies about companies and CEOs, Comparisun calculated the average yearly % growth over the last five years and applied this rate of growth for each future year to try and predict how the value will change.
