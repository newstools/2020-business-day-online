 Nigerian stock investors should still brace up for more turbulence in the market this week, as some of the risks to sustained rally persist. Currently, many investors are watching the progress of Nigeria’s states in recent gradual reopening of their economies without fueling a resurgence in Coronavirus (Covid-19) cases. A pile-up of worrying domestic and international news prompts these investors to pull back on equities after the record rally in April. Among others, the reoccurring risks to investors decisions to raise equities bet on the Nigerian Stock Exchange include outlook on 2020 economic growth, crude oil price, concerns on FX supply, dwindling corporate earnings, corporate job losses, etc. The stock market ended the trading week to Friday May 15 on a negative note as uninspiring performance in heavy weighted counters like Dangote Cement and MTNN dragged the All Share Index southward. “We expect the market to witness the same sentiment in the next session”, said equity research analysts at FBN Quest.
The domestic bourse had retreated after two consecutive weeks of gains. Also in their opinion, Cordros research analysts said market risks remain on the horizon “due to a combination of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions.” “Thus, we continue to advise investors to trade cautiously and seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks”, they added. Stock nvestors on the Nigerian Bourse had priced-in risks to Nigeria’s economic growth as petro dollar income dwindled. Naira was seen weakened on the black market to N450/$ as dollar demand increased from foreign investors and importers with payment obligations that accumulated amid hard currency shortages triggered by an oil price crash. Meanwhile the naira was seen rangebound on the official and over-the-counter spot markets as bidders resisted weakening the currency since the majority of dollar supply is from the Central Bank. Though, last Friday the price of Brent crude oil rose to $32.50 as new data pointed to a rebound in demand around the world as more countries begin gradual easing of economic lockdown.
