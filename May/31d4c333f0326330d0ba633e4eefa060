 11 Plc, formerly Mobil Nigeria Plc, and Ardova Plc, formerly Forte Oil Plc, both recorded double-digit growth in their revenues in the first quarter of 2020. 11 Plc grew its Q1 2020 revenue by 17.8 percent to N54.28 billion up from N46.07 billion in Q1 2019. But its cost of sales mirrored revenue generation in that it grew by 22.1 percent from N42.4 billion in Q1 2019 to N51.8 billion in Q1 2020. The implication of the rising cost of sales in the first quarter is that cost to sales rose from 92.1 percent in Q1 2019 to 95.5 percent in Q1 2020. Consequently, gross profit declined by 32.6 percent to N2.46 billion in Q1 2020 from N3.65 billion in Q1 2019. Other income grew by 2 percent from N2.01 billion to N2.05 billion during the reference periods. But that increase was cancelled out by an 8 percent and 5.5 percent increase in selling and administration expenses and administration expenses respectively. “The Covid 19 crisis continues to impact all businesses, with the effect expected to be more pronounced in the future.
