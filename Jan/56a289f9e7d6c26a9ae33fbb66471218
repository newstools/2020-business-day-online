The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it would henceforth stop the process of collating election results in constituencies marred by violence. INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, stated this at a meeting of Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) held over the weekend in Abuja, noting that the commission would no longer tolerate attacks on it personnel and invading of collation centres. “Going forward, INEC has decided that although the Commission has no power under the law to cancel an election, it will not proceed with the process in any constituency where the safety of voters, our personnel and materials is threatened. “Furthermore, collation of results will not proceed where the collation centres are invaded. No declaration of winners will be made where Returning Officers are threatened,” Mahmood said.
