The Etim John-led state working committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State said at the weekend that they were not part of a plot to disrupt Local Government Elections slated for March this year by Cross River State Independent Electoral Commission (CROSIEC). In a press statement signed by Francis Epeyong, a copy of which was made available to our correspondent, the APC secretary said: “We are aware that a dissident group in our party had taken CROSIEC to court over the conduct of Local Government Elections in Cross River State. “The Etim John-led state working committee, which is legal and authentic, wishes to dissociate ourselves completely from this illegal matters parading in court in the name of our party. “We hereby urge CROSIEC and relevant stakeholders to continue to keep faith in our desire to conduct free, fair credible polls which is the accepted norm in our electoral system nationwide.” Recall that the State Independent Electoral Commission had fixed March 2020 as the date for local government election in Cross River State after about three years of non-conduct of council polls in the state. “For the avoidance of doubt, this same dissident group had taken CROSIEC to court for non-conduct of local polls and when attempt is made to conduct elections at that tier of government, they will go to truncate the exercise through frivolous petitions. “We appeal to our supporters to cooperate with the electoral umpire to enthrone democratically elected chairmen at that tier of government which is the wish of our people,” the statement added.
