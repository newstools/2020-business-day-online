 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has dismissed claims by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the Commission has appointed the Vice-Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Eyitope Ogunbodede, as Returning Officer for this Saturday’s Ondo governorship election. The Chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council and Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde at a press conference on Thursday alleged that INEC has appointed Ogunbodede, a kinsman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Candidate, Rotimi Akeredolu as the Returning Officer for the Ondo polls. But INEC in a press statement by its National Commissioner & Chairman Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye said the Returning Officer for the Ondo Governorship election is not from Ondo State and not from the University mentioned in the said press conference.
