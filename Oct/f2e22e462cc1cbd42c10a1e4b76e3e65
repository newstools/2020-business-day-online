 Despite the protest, the Senate on Tuesday confirmed Aisha Umar (North East) as the Director-General of the National Pension Commission (PENCOM). This followed the adoption of the screening report presented by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Establishment and Public Service Matters, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau. The report overruled the petition written by the Minority Leader, Senator Eyinaya Abaribe, against her nomination as the Director General-designate. Abaribe had argued that Umar from the North East was not from the same zone as the immediate past DG, Mrs. Chinelo Anohu-Amazu, from the South-East, who was removed before the completion of her tenure. According to him, the nomination violated the Act that established PENCOM. The Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, explained that the nomination was for a fresh board and not the continuation of the expired one, so could not be taken for a replacement. Umar was among the six nominees of President Muhammdu Buhari for appointments into the PENCOM. The Senate, however, stepped down the confirmation of Hannatu Musawa as a Commissioner representing North West. The committee in its report stated that Musawa failed to present her National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) discharge certificate. Those confirmed are Dr. Oyindasola Oni, North Central, (chairman), Aisha Umar, North East, (Director-General); Clement Akintola, South West, (Commissioner); Ayim C. Nyerere, South East (Commissioner) and Charles Emukowhale, South-South, (Commissioner). Abaribe while opposing Umar had said, “I recall that the tenure of the incumbent was truncated therefore the new letter from the president that has now moved the Chairman of the Commission to another zone may not be correct. “it is against the law setting up the National Pension Commission and the Federal Character Commission.”
