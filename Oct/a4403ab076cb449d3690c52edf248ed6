 The candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2020 Ondo Governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, has expressed dissatisfaction over the failure of INEC card reader to accept his fingerprints when it was time to cast his vote. BusinessDay reports that Jegede, the PDP candidate, who arrived at the Polling unit 009, Ward 02, Gbogi/Isikan 1, Sacred Heart Primary School, Akure South Local Government of Ondo state in company of his wife, Eno, at 9am waited on the queue for almost three hours. When it was time to cast his vote, the card reader rejected his fingerprints. Speaking after casting his vote, Jegede lamented the malfunctioning of the card reader, but still expressed optimism that he would emerge victorious in the election as he said that the electorate were already voting and PDP would emerge victorious at the end of the election. “The performance of Ondo was very good. The voters have conducted themselves very well, the turnout is massive but unfortunately it is INEC that is creating a problem,” he said. The PDP candidate, however, advised INEC to fix the issues with the card reader in order not to undermine the credibility of the process.
