 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the killing of peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos as well as other parts of our country. In a statement on Tuesday night, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was shocking that security agents and thugs reportedly killed peaceful protesters. The statement said, ‘It is shocking that security agents and, in some cases,thugs, were reportedly deployed to end the lives of promising Nigerians. This, to say the least, is saddening. “Those responsible for the heinous murder of the innocent and harmless Nigerians must account for their nefarious acts. “The PDP calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately direct an end to these wanton killings across our nation. “We invite the International Criminal Court (ICC), to bring all those responsible for the needless death of these very young Nigerians to justice.”
