 The governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi, has debunked the rumours that he has withdrawn from the election, urging the public to disregard the rumour. The deputy governor, who spoke with journalists at his Kiribo hometown Saturday morning, said he would not resign or back out from the race since he is winning ultimately. He alleged that the fake news was being sponsored by his boss and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC),, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, as well as his cohorts. Allen Sowore, Media Adviser to the deputy governor, who also reacted to the rumour, said, “The attention of the Deputy Governor and candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Agboola Ajayi has been drawn to a forged resignation letter from the Governorship Election holding today, Saturday 10 October, 2020.” He said the state governor and APC candidate, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, and his media hirelings would stop at nothing to peddle fake news. “This fake news being sponsored by the outgoing Governor and his cohorts. It’s not different from the earlier ones sponsored and paid for that the Zenith Labour Party’s Candidate, Agboola Ajayi is working with the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Eyitayo Jegede SAN. Nothing can be farther from the truth. “For the umpteenth time, and for the purposes of clarity and emphasis, the Deputy Governor and candidate of ZLP, Agboola Ajayi will not resign or back out from the race he’s winning ultimately. “The general public, members of our great party and most importantly the electorate should therefore disregard this latest antics of the drowning party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “Rather than moving around with the false news. Governor Akeredolu should be courageous enough to accept defeat in good faith,” he said,
