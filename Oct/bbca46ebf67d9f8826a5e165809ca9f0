 The Department of State Services (DSS) has assured the public and stakeholders in the Ondo State governorship election scheduled for October 10, 2020 of its support and preparedness for the polls. Public relations Officer of DSS, Peter Afunanya, said in a statement on Wednesday that the Service will not only partner with sister security agencies but support the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the election is hitch-free. The DSS also enjoined its personnel to remain professional while discharging their duties. “The service, therefore, urges all players in the electoral process to abide by the rules of the game. Persons and groups that may wish to engage in violent activities leading to break down of law and order are advised to desist from such devious plans or be ready to face the full wrath of the law,” the statement said. Meanwhile, the United States (US) has urged all stakeholders to continue to work toward free, fair, transparent, and peaceful elections in Ondo State.
