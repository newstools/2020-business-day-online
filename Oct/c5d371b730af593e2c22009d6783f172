The Deputy Governor of Kaduna state, Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe who was represented by the Deputy Chief of Staff, Barrister James Kanyip said the State is committed to supporting the program and actualising the empowerment of women and youths. According to him, the project will not only be beneficial to the state but Nigeria at large. He said the program is timely and apt, considering the fact that the country is now diversifying its economy, hence the effort of government in giving its citizens other opportunities through the various Value-Chains. ” Since the country now is diversifying from oil to agriculture, the Agro-Processing Productivity Enhancement And Livelihood Improvement Support Project (APPEAL) is a good project,” he concluded.
