 Palpable fear on Sunday gripped residents of Ondo state as supporters of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Eyitayo Jegede, candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) clashed again, shooting sporadically in the air ahead of next Saturday governorship election in the state. BusinessDay learnt that the incessant bloody clash, which has created tension among the residents, especially those who live at Akure, the state capital was a reprisal attack by suspected APC thugs following an attack on their members at Ijomu/Oba Nla areas of the state by PDP thugs on Saturday night. Recall that two weeks ago, eight people were also injured in a clash between supporters of these political parties at Oba Akoko, Akoko South-West Local Government Area of the state as several vehicles were also vandalised during the confrontation. However, both PDP and APC have accused each other of causing the violence as different statements had been issued in recent time by both leadership of the APC and PDP, suggesting accusations and counter accusations. According to a source, policemen who were drafted from A-Division Police Station which was few meters away from the scene of the crisis, could not stop the thugs who were said to be heavily armed. But, Tee-Leo Ikoro, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), said the police are already investigating the matter and warned hoodlums to steer clear of the state as there will not be hidden place for them before, during and after the governorship poll in the state.
