 No fewer than 10 major parties out of the 17 participating political parties have resolved to support Eyitayo Jegede, the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in the next Saturday governorship election in Ondo state. The parties are Accord Party (AP), Action Alliance (AA), Action Democratic Party (ADP), (All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), (African Action Congress (AAC), Allied People’s Movement (APM), APP, New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) National Rescue Movement (NRM) and Social Democratic (SDP). The 10 political parties made the resolution on Monday at the PDP Secretariat in Akure, the Ondo State capital as part of political moves to wrest power from Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s government of All Progressives Congress (APC). Oladele Ogunbameru, the state Chairman of Social Democratic Party (SDP), who spoke on behalf of other political parties, said the decision was made on Sunday (October 4, 2020) at a meeting held with their party leaders and chieftains of the PDP. According to Ogunbameru, the move was borne out of their commitment to good governance in the state, which they believe can only be offered by the PDP. But while reacting to the new development, Fatai Adams, the State PDP chairman, said the support from these 10 political parties has indicated the acceptability of Jegede which shows that the party will emerge victorious on Saturday.
