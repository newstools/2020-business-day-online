 The National Secretary of United Political Parties (CUPP) and immediate past President of the Inter Party Advisory Council of Nigeria (IPAC), Peter Ameh has condemned the unlawful killings of innocent Nigerians as well as Law enforcement agents and Police Officers across the Country. Ahmeh in a statement in Abuja said it is of great concern that lives of innocent Nigerians could be so easily taken away without recourse to the law and due process. According to him, the killing of innocent citizens as well as law enforcement agents and destruction of public and private properties across the States of the Federation does not, in any way, define who Nigerians are as a people. “These recent occurrences are a clear sign of failure of government and the urgent need for a revisitation of the Nation’s structural architecture to make it viable and sustainable. “Our youths have remained united in their collective resolve for a decent standard of living as well as their struggle for a well reformed Police force”, the CUPP Scribe said. He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to take all necessary steps needed to reconnect with the Nigerian Youths and understand the pulse of the Nigerian people. Ahmeh also urged all State Governors to be proactive and immediately champion security of lives and property of citizens within their respective States. “Being the most populous black Nation in the world and the great giant of the African continent, I remain very optimistic that Nigeria will once again rise to occupy her rightful place amongst comity of nations”, he added.
