 Aiming to join other nations in achieving the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.9 to provide legal identity for all, including free birth registrations by 2030, Nigeria is actively working towards increasing enrolment of its citizens in a digital identity database which will help economic development. The National Identity Management Commission, (NIMC), has pledged to scale up enrolment and issuance of the unique National Identification Numbers (NIN) to Nigerians and legal residents, from 500,000 to 2.5 Million record monthly in a renewed commitment towards the provision of Identity services to the nation. This assurance was given by Aliyu Aziz, the Director-General/CEO, of NIMC, while playing host to Isa Ali Pantami, the minister of communications and economy, who was on an official visit to the Commission’s head office in Abuja. During the visit, the minister, who disclosed that the visit to NIMC was his first official visit to any of the parastatals under his ministry, charged NIMC to increase and improve its performance with regards to NIN registration and issuance. He also reiterated a target of 2.5million monthly enrolment. While briefing Pantami on the activities of the commission, Aziz restated the commitment of the management and staff of the NIMC towards meeting and surpassing the monthly target as part of the policy statements in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS). He emphasised that the commission has competent human resources and looks forward to Government support and intervention in injecting much needed material resources to realise the set objectives. In recognition of the importance of digital identity in actualising the digital economy goals, the minister commended the strides recorded by the commission despite limited resources, while assuring the commission of his continuous support and guidance towards ensuring the fulfilment of its mandate. Pantami told the commission that he has initiated moves to improve the staff welfare. Similarly, Pantami assured the NIMC management and staff of his resolve to improve the state of the current infrastructure and equipment to enable the commission be better and sustain its performance towards the discharge of this critical national assignment
