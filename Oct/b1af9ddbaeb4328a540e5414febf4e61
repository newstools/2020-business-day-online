 Some people get into business with high expectations only to back out when threatened by challenges but an uprising entrepreneur, Chinweike Nwankwo has a word for them, “Consistency is the key to rise to the top”. Nwankwo, chief executive officer of Chinwinx Farms located in Ibuza, near Asaba the Delta State Capital, said his fish enterprise has risen from three ponds to 13 ponds because of consistency. The fish in the ponds have also increased from 2,000 to 12,000 within a period of four years, he said. The young CEO, who disclosed that he employed six staff to work in his farm within the period, said he also engages in consultancy services in fish production and processing. “I’ve also trained about 100 Deltans as a feedback to the state, for the training I received as a beneficiary of its Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurs Programme (YAGEP) under the Job and Wealth Creation Programme 2015/2016 Cycle. Out of the 100 persons, 60 were trained free of charge while the rest paid to receive the training,” he said. Speaking in an exclusive interview with BDSUNDAY in Asaba, Chinweike said: “At the end of the YAGEP training in 2016, I was empowered with three fish ponds at the Delta State Agricultural Development Programme located at Ibuza. Each YAGEP beneficiary was also given 2,000 fishes and 145 bags of feeds (super), to start fishery enterprises. From then, the growth process started and as part of the growth process, I acquired additional 10 fish ponds. “Every now and then, the fishes are harvested when they mature. Early August this year, over 7,000 fishes were harvested out the 12,000 fishes, leaving only little fingerlings which I placed there.” According to him, “The 12,000 is the benchmark for the 13 ponds because going beyond that would mean to stress the fishes.”
