 Plans are in top gear for the inauguration of the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, for a second term in office, which will hold alongside the annual Alaghodaro Summit. Governor Obaseki will be sworn into office along with his deputy, Philip Shaibu, for another term of four years on November 12, 2020. The swearing-in ceremony is fused with the yearly Alaghodaro Summit held to showcase the numerous achievements, reforms and initiatives of the Governor Obaseki-led administration and engage with key stakeholders in assessing progress made in the governor’s first term in office. Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, in a statement reassured that the Obaseki-led government will in the second term continue on the economic trajectory of fiscal discipline and prudence, prioritisation of human capital projects and driving impactful social welfare programmes. He noted that the Alaghodaro Summit, in its fourth edition, is anchored on the ‘Making Edo Great Again’ manifesto of the governor and will focus on the government’s delivery on promises in education, health care, and job creation, among others. “Plans are in top gear for the inauguration of Governor Godwin Obaseki for a second term in office as Benin City has become a beehive of activities,” Osagie said. “The inauguration of the governor and his deputy coincides with the fourth edition of our yearly Alaghodaro Summit which showcases reforms, policies and programmes implemented by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration aimed at opening up the space for private investment, inclusive economic growth and improvement of the people’s livelihood,” he said.
