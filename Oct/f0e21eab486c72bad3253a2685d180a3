 The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Adamawa, Thursday accused the Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri led Adamawa State Government of repackaging and diverting the federal government’s palliative meant to cushion the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the masses. Ibrahim Bilal, APC state chairman made the accusation while addressing party members in Yola. Bilal insinuated that instead of distributing the palliative to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown as directed by the federal government, the state government diverted the palliative for political purpose to silence the opposition APC. ” The APC led federal government had donated thousands metric tonnes of palliative to the state government to cushion the effect of COVID-19 lockdown. And we are aware, the palliative is been repackaged and labeled with some top Government’s officials pictures for political campaign, as if they are the ones who purchased and supplied the items. They are campaigning with the palliative to cripple the APC strength in the state. ” Bilal said. The chairman noted that many vulnerable people of the state whose condition the federal government intended to assuage were left in penury as nothing gets to them. Bilal said that there was need for the authority concern handling the palliative to listen and take action. Reacting to the allegations, Solomon Kumanga, Director General, Media and Communications to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, dismissed the accusation and described it as ” unfounded “. Kumanga stated that no responsible government would divert the palliative meant for its people and used it as political weapon. ” I think it is Adamawa State APC that is politicising the palliative issue to get cheap political sympathy from the top. The accusation is absolute not truth and let him substantiate his claims if any. ” State Government has being distributing the palliative to the people of the state across 21 LGAs irrespective of political differences,” Kumanga said.
