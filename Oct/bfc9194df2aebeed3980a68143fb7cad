 Babatunde Gbadamosi, candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for the October 31 senatorial by-election, has said that he was confident of emerging victorious by defeating his main rival and candidate of the ruling All ruling Progressives Congress (APC), Tokunbo Abiru in the election. The Lagos East Senatorial seat became vacant after the death of Senator Bayo Osinowo. Gbadamosi, a real estate mogul, was the Action Democratic Party (ADP) governorship candidate in the 2019 election. Speaking with journalists shortly after opening his campaign office in Shomolu, Gbadamosi said the APC candidate was not his match because contesting the by-election was not his decision. He promised purposeful representation of the constituency if elected; stressing that it was time the people of the constituency were liberated from the grip of some individuals in the state. The PDP stressed that the constituency had not received enough attention by successive administrations in the state, while lamenting the decay of infrastructure. According to him, “We are confident that we would take this seat because of the special dynamics that exist in Lagos East. Lagos East is one of the most deprived in terms of infrastructure, a lot of investment from people like me, Dangote, and others in Ikorodu, but all this investment has not been accompanied by infrastructure by the government.
