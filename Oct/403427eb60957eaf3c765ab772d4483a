 The All Progressives Congress (APC) Wednesday said, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and it’s leaders are directly and indirectly sponsoring the #ENDSARS protests and playing politics with the development. The governing party in a statement by its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Nabena Yekini however said it will not join issues with the opposition PDP on the development which the #ENDSARS protest has taken. Yekini noted that since the protest started, the PDP elements have taken over the social media making various unguarded assertions thereby fueling the protest. He said: “It is on record that one of the leaders of #EndSARS protest in Akwa Ibom State three days ago publicly admitted that the state governor, Udom Emmanuel, gave N4 million for onward sharing to the protesting youth in Uyo, the state capital. “Kufre Carter, one of the organisers of the protest reportedly said he got a call from the governor’s aide on youth matters whom he said told him that the governor gave N4 million to be shared to the protesters. “The APC caretaker committee chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state has righly noted the hidden agenda in the #EndSARS protests. “Like our chairman said all leaders (including PDP leaders) should know that it is only when the country exists in peace that one can achieve their goals, you cannot be a leader through chaos, it will not be well. “We, however, repeat our appeal to the protesting youths to give dialogue and peace a chance while ignoring insensitive fueling by the PDP”.
