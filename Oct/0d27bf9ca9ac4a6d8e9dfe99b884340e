 Candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Agboola Ajayi, has said that he will definitely defeat all other Governorship candidates, including his boss and ruling party – Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and All Progressives Congress (APC), in the Saturday governorship election to emerge the next governor of the state. Ajayi, the deputy governor, while speaking in Owo, home town of Governor Akeredolu at the final campaign tour for the Governorship election in Ondo on Wednesday, said he has all what it takes to defeat his boos and other candidates on Saturday. The deputy governor, who urged the residents not to panic during the Saturday’s election but go out and cast their votes for ZLP, maintained that the threat of violence before, during and after the election being sponsored by the ruling APC and PDP was an empty one as security agencies would be on ground to protect their lives and properties. He, however, advised his supporters not to take arms against anybody but should go out, vote and make sure their votes count on the election day. Speaking at the campaign tour, the National Leader of the party and former governor of the state, Olusegun Mimiko, said many people were scared to attend political rallies because of the violence of the past. According to him, about five people have lost their lives in the last few weeks as a result of political violence caused by the ruling APC. “They should ask Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu why his party members are using guns to pursue members of rival political parties”, Mimiko said.
