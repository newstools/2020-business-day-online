 The Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has disclosed that he honoured Thursday’s invitation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) because he has nothing to hide. The EFCC on Thursday questioned Obasa over allegations of fraud and financial misappropriation levelled against him. However, reacting in a short statement late Thursday, the lawmaker said he was obliged to honour the invitation considering the position he currently occupied. “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission invited me today (Thursday). As a responsible citizen and lawmaker, I honoured the invitation. I have nothing to hide. “When we are called upon by law-enforcement agents in their investigations, as responsible citizens, it’s our duty to oblige them,” Obasa said. The spokesperson of the commission, Wilson Uwujaren, had confirmed early Thursday that Obasa, a close political associate of the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu had honoured invitation by the EFCC to respond to the allegations. “All I can confirm for now is that he was invited and responded to the invitation today,” Uwujaren had said. Recall that the Speaker had some months back appeared before the House panel of enquiry on the corruption allegations; the committee, however, exonerated him of any wrongdoing and even asked anyone with evidence to come forward. Obasa has consistently denied most of the allegations, but he admitted that N80 million as estacode was approved for the training of the wives of 20 lawmakers in Dubai. “We gave N4m to each of the participants for air tickets, hotels, feedings, and local travel. Air ticket to Dubai alone costs about N2m”, Obasa had said.
