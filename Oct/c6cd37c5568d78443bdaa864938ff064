 The candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) for the October 31 senatorial by-election in Lagos East, Tokunbo Abiru has commiserated with the families of the victims of an explosion that occurred at Best Roof Cooking Gas Plant, Baruwa, Alimosho Local Government on Thursday. Abiru, a former commissioner for Finance in Lagos State, described the explosion as avoidable if necessary safety measures had been in place before the incident that claimed lives and destroyed properties worth of millions of naira. He expressed this concern in a statement he issued on Thursday, tasking the Lagos State Government and Department Petroleum Resources (DPR) to synergise on the need for all the operators of gas plants to comply with health, safety and environment standards. In a two-page statement he personally signed on Thursday, the APC candidate urged Lagos residents statewide “to always report cases of violation anywhere health, safety and environment standards are compromised in the state.” According to him, “Every Lagosian must take this obligation seriously in support of the government and as a measure to forestall avoidable loss of lives, destruction of assets and disruption of public life in the future.”
