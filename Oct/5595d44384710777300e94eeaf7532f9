 The House of Representatives has begun the process of altering the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), to set time within which civil and criminal cases and matters are heard and determined at trial and appellate courts in order to eliminate unnecessary delay in justice administration and delivery. The move is contained in a Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Cap. C23, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, sponsored by Onofiok Luke, member representing Etinan/ Nsit Ibom/ Nsit Ubium Federal Constituency of Akwa Ibom State. The Bill, which had scaled through first reading in the Green Chamber and a copy of which was sighted by BusinessDay, states that Chapter VII, Part IV of the Principal Act (1999 Constitution) is altered by inserting after section 287, a new section “287A”. The section “287A (1) provides that in any civil or criminal matter except in election petition, a trial superior court of record shall deliver its judgment in writing within 270 days from the date of the filing of the civil or criminal matter. It also states that in any civil or criminal matter except in election petition, a trial inferior court of record or tribunal shall deliver its judgment in writing within 210 days from the date of the filing of the civil or criminal matter. The amendment stipulates that notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section: “A trial superior court of record may deliver its judgment in writing within 330 having regard to the circumstances of the matter and in particular to the complexity of the matter, number of parties, number of witnesses, number of documents or other exceptional circumstances. “A trial inferior court of record may deliver its judgment in writing within 270, having regard to the circumstances of the matter and in particular to the complexity of the matter, number of parties, number of witnesses, number of documents or other exceptional circumstances”.
