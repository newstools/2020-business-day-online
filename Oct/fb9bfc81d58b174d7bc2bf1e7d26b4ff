 The governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have said they are united and strong behind the party’s candidate in October 10 Ondo governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede. The governors in a statement issued by the Director General of PDP Governors Forum (PDPGF), Cyril Maduabum, denied supporting the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, Agboola Ajayi. They stated this in a reaction to a media report that the support of the forum’s chairman and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, had caused a disaffection among the governors. The statement read, “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP Governors’ Forum is united, strong and primed to do its utmost to elect our candidate in the Ondo Governorship election, EYITAYO JEGEDE, SAN, who has the experience, dynamism and programme of action to return Ondo State to her glory days. “We think that the story is the handwork of fifth columnists, who are afraid of the popularity of the PDP candidate and his likely victory, and has devised this means of creating doubts in the minds of Nigerians as a strategy for stopping the march of victory by PDP in Ondo. “Nothing can stop the march of progress in Ondo. Indeed, Jegede’s victory is one whose time has come. ” The Forum speaks with one voice and this naked attempt to sow division and discord within its ranks has failed miserably.” The statement said the governors rose from a virtual meeting a few days ago with a firm resolve and commitment to make sure that all hands were on deck to support and deliver the PDP candidate. It added, ‘The PDP governors are fully aware of the importance of the Ondo elections to the image, solidarity and fortunes of the PDP as a political party. “The governors are in no doubt that any division in its ranks will be counter productive to PDP, her candidate and its quest to restore democracy, good governance, and accountability not only in Ondo State but Nigeria at large.”
