 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has postponed the bye-elections in six Senatorial Districts and nine State Constituencies, scheduled for October 31 due to the ntaionwide #EndSARS protests. INEC’s decision is in compliance with Section 26 (2) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), which gives it the power to postpone an election if there is reason to believe that a serious breach of the peace is likely to occur if the election is proceeded with on that date, or that it is impossible to conduct the elections as a result of natural disasters or other emergencies. Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee announced this in a statement at the end of a meeting with the 37 Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to review preparations for the 15 bye-elections in 11 States of the Federation. Okoye said the Commission will continue to monitor the situation in all the States and Constituencies, consult with relevant stakeholders and meet again in two weeks to review the situation and decide on a feasible date for the elections. “The Commission appeals for calm and understanding of the stakeholders and voters in the States where elections were scheduled. The safety of the voters, election officials and other stakeholders is paramount to the Commission in conducting elections. “We are convinced that the country will emerge from the current challenges stronger while our electoral process will continue to improve”, he noted
