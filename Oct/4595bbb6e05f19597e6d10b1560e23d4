 Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has denied the media report that he signed from PDP and joined the All Progressive Congress, (APC). News from some quarter on Saturday has it that the Umahi defected to APC. The report credited to the house of reps member Representing Ezza South/ Ikwo federal constituency Chinedu Ogah congratulated the governor and urged other southeast governors to join the ruling party. But the Governor in a statement from his special assistant on media denied the report describing it as fake. The statement read, “My attention has been drawn to the news making round in some quarters of the media, alleging that the Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Umahi has defected to the All Progressive Congress (APC). “The news is a product of a figment of imagination on the part of the carriers as Governor Umahi was, is, and is still flying the flag of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “It is, however, difficult to observe how people are easily persuaded to believe in fake dummies in the name of rumours. “If for any reason, Governor Umahi wishes to leave the People Democratic Party (PDP), it will be officially communicated and can never be a product from rumour mongers. “The general public is advised to jettison such unfounded rumour.
