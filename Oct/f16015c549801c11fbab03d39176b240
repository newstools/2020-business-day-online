 Ahead of the Saturday governorship election in Ondo State, the National Chairman of Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus has tasked the people of the state, particularly eligible voters to vote out the ruling Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and All Progressives Congress (APC). Secondus made the call Wednesday at the grand finale campaign of the party held in Ondo City, the headquarters of Ondo West Local Government Area of the state. According to him, the opposition party, PDP, mobilised strongly to defeat APC in the last governorship election in Ondo State. He said the party had failed Nigerians woefully at all levels. Secondus, who blamed the Akeredolu APC administration and its supporters for the recurring violence in the state, added that Governor Akeredolu and his supporters were jittery of the growing popularity of the PDP candidate, Eyitayo Jegede. Speaking on how to curtail the pockets of crises threatening the Saturday election, he advised that INEC and security agencies should be allowed to do their duties professionally without interference. Like it was done in Edo State recently, Secondus appealed to the people to protect their votes and resist any attempt by the ruling party to rig the election. He urged them to come out en masse to vote for the PDP and defeat the APC governorship candidate, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who is seeking a re-election.
