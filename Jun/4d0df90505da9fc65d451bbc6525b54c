 John Odigie -Oyegun, the immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said the internal democracy of the party has been murdered following the disqualification of Governor Godwin Obaseki from contesting the party’s governorship primary election. Odigie-Oyegun, who made the remarks on Friday  in a statement signed by his media adviser, Ray Morphy, in Abuja, said the disqualification of the governor will have a devastating impact to the party if the decision is not reversed. According to him, while not a surprise, that disqualification is a clear indication that internal democracy has been murdered in APC, a party which we founded on the principles of fair play and good conscience! “I daresay that APC will suffer dire consequences in Edo state if this disqualification is not speedily reversed. “As a matter of fact, Oshiomhole is indeed the one who is guilty of anti-party (activities), not Obaseki. Oshiomhole is the one who is acting unconstitutionally not Obaseki. I hope that Oshiomhole will not go down in history as the undertaker of APC,” he said.
