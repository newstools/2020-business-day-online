Also, the gradual re-opening of economic activities by the government in Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Egypt, and Mauritius have since supported activities at the equity market. Similarly, rebalancing in the global commodity market amid output cut by Oil exporting countries, easy monetary policy, and gradual reopening of business activities in China, Germany and increasing number of States in the US have since spurred some risk-on sentiment.
