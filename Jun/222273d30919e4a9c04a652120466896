 Fresh troubles may be brewing in Edo State as the All Progressives Congress (APC) has disqualified Governor Godwin Obaseki from contesting the June 22 governorship primaries of the party over certificates irregularities. Chairman of the APC Edo Governorship primaries Screening Committee, Jonathan announced this Friday at APC National Secretariat Abuja while presenting report of the screening exercise to the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. He also said Chris Ogiemwonyi an Matthew Iduoriyekemwen have been disqualified while Osagie Ize-Iyamu, Pius Odubu, and Osaro Obazee have been cleared to run for the primaries. As anticipated, Obaseki after his screening Wednesday night said, he was not sure of getting justice under Oshiomhole whom he described as an interested party in the Edo Governorship primaries. “Like I said, as a party man I have been through the screening process but I do not believe that I will get justice because Comrade Adams Oshiomhole is an interested party in the Edo process”, the Edo Governor lamented. Obaseki said he was accused of anti-party activities for signing a gazette that will prevent the party from conducting direct primaries in Edo State. “One of the questions that was asked was that why did I issue a gazette that will prevent the party from performing direct elections in Edo. That did I not see it as an anti party activity? I just felt that if we put politics above the the lives of the people of Edo State, the we may be missing the point”, he noted.  James Kwen, Abuja
