 Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike on Monday, said Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki, was declared ineligible to contest for the governorship primary election on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), by someone who doesn’t have a certificate. This is coming barely 24 hours after Obaseki held a closed door meeting with his Rivers and Akwa Ibom state counterparts at their respective government houses. Both governors are of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and there are indications that Obaseki is seeking a platform to contest the forthcoming governorship election scheduled to hold in September 19. It would be recalled that Godwin Obaseki was disqualified by the seven-man screening committee from the primary election slated for June 22, based on discrepancies in his credentials. However, reacting to Obaseki’s disqualification through his Twitter handle, Nyesom said Obaseki was disqualified by someone who doesn’t have a certificate. What an irony!”
