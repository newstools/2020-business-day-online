 Equity transactions on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) fell by 58 percent to N9.88 billion last week as against N23.6 billion in the previous week partly due to the number of trading days which was reduced to four as a result of the Federal Government’s declaration of Friday June 12,2020 as a Democracy Day. Another contributing fact was low investor sentiment in the market. As a result, the number of deals fell to 16,616 last week compared with 22,911 deals in the previous week. Last week, 1.1 billion shares were traded last week as against 1.46 billion shares in the previous week. It should be recalled that in 2019, the Nigerian government declared June 12 as the new Democracy Day for the country in honour of Nigeria’s fairest and freest  presidential election held on June 12 1993 which was won by the late MKO Abiola but was annulled by the military regime headed by the former president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB).
