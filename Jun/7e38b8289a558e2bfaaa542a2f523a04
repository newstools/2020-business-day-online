 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday said it is saddened by the death of a former Governor of Oyo state and immediate past acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abiola Ajimobi. Describing his death as a national tragedy, the PDP noted that the demise is a huge loss not only to the APC and his state, Oyo but also to the entire nation. Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary stated this in a statement issued in Abuja and made available to newsmen.
