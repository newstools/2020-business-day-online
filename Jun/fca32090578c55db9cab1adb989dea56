The market capitalisation of the equities listed on the premium board increased by N175.14 bn to N5.40 trillion from N5.23 trillion in Q1 2019. The increase was as a result of the listing of additional stock as eight equities were listed on the premium board in Q1 2020 whereas the number was seven in Q1 2019. The number of equities listed on the main board fell to 141 in Q1 2020 as against 147 in Q1 2019.
