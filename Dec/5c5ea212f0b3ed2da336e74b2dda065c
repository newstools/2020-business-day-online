 Bashir Omolaja Bolarunwa, chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC), Kwara State chapter, has called on members to shun all divisive tendencies and remain united for the party to progress. The state chairman of the party made the call on Monday during the inauguration of party’s caretaker committee members for state, local government and wards held in Ilorin, the state capital. He says all party men and women should come together to promote party unity and cohesion, urging them to remain forward looking and ensure they did not betray the trust repose in them by the electorates. Bolarinwa equally advised all party members to avail themselves the opportunity of the forthcoming membership revalidation to renew their registration. He however, assured the residents of the state of the determination of party to fulfil all its campaign promises. “Today, we are gathered for this epoch making ceremony to inaugurate the Caretaker Committee of State, Local and Ward levels of our party APC.

We cannot afford to do so as a divided house. We cannot afford to betray the trust reposed in us by Kwarans in 2019,” he said. “As we prepare for the registration by INEC and revaluation of our membership, I urge us to be aggressive and dogged in our new membership drive, so that it can translate to another electoral victory for our party,” Bolarinwa said.
