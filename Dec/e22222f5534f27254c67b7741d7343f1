 A new movie has been launched to address the high rate of victimization, harassment, and blackmail in today’s corporate organisations in the country. The 25 minutes movie titled ‘The Exit Interview’ shows the high rate of workplace victimization and harassment in a society burdened with job insecurity, gender imbalance & paycheck uncertainty. The movie tells of a storyline where Caroline Igben featured as Amaka seeks to break the spine of injustice and corruption of the charlatans in her workplace. “I watched the movie and I must say I could relate to it 100percent. Things like this happen right under the nose in the corporate world but it doesn’t get discussed at all,” an ardent viewer, Olivia Smith said. “I am intrigued,” said a retired banker of over 25years. “What I just watched it and is a real event turned to a movie. It may not flow the same way but it is really what happens in behind the corporate curtain – something I have witnessed before,” he added. The story is focused on addressing the high rate of victimization, harassment, and blackmail in the corporate society which people fail to talk about. The Exit Interview is produced by Boat Films and directed by Babjide Aroyewun. It stars Caroline Igben, Heaven Kalu, Chidinma Ifunanyachi and Tess Uttie, and other top actors and actresses.
