 The governorship candidate of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the October 10, 2020 gubernatorial election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, has assured the party’s members and people of the state that PDP would soon take over power from All Progressives Congress-led administration in the state. Jegede gave the assurance of taking over political power from Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of APC on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital during the inauguration of the newly reconstructed party’s secretariat. The PDP governorship candidate while commending Goddey Erewa, the party member, who single-handedly rebuilt the Secretariat which was razed during #EndSARS protest, declared that PDP is too big and strong to be destroyed. According to him, those who razed the Secretariat didn’t know that the party could not be subdued but rather became stronger and more united despite the attack on the party’s Secretariat. Jegede commended the state Chairman of the party, Fatai Adams for providing good leadership within the short time he took over leadership of the party. He also commended everyone who contributed to the decoration and equipping of the new secretariat, enjoining all members of the party to think of what they could do for the party rather what the party could do for them. Adams noted that despite the damage inflicted on the party, it has consistently continued to gain support of the people of the state. Commending Erewa for rebuilding the party’s Secretariat, Adams disclosed that Jegede has been assisting the Secretariat financially, revealing that the December salaries of their staff have been paid. In his short address, Erewa noted that the Secretariat would serve as the converging point, and help energise, embolden and boost the morale of party faithful and supporters.
