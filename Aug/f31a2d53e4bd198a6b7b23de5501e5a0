 Armed men suspected to be robbers on Monday attacked the campaign convoy of the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu at Erua Village in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of the State. BusinessDay gathered that the armed men who were probably on a robbery operation fell a tree to block the Benin-Auchi expressway, a few metres away from Jehovah’s Witness international headquarters. It was gathered that the hoodlums who were said to have laid siege few metres away from a police checkpoint mistook the governor’s convoy for a prominent personality. The Security operatives attached to the convoy, however, repelled the armed robbers from attacking the convoy. A source who witnessed the incident said the governor’s convoy was moving slowly without blaring a siren. “Upon sighting the Governor’s convoy, the hoodlums fired a gunshot, but the security operatives attached to the Governor and his deputy, Hon. Philip Shaibu, repelled the robbers who fled into nearby bushes. “The armed robbers thought it was just a VIP that was coming. The Governor’s convoy was not blaring siren and was moving slowly when the attempt was made. “Immediately, the convoy approached where they laid siege. While we were thinking of what to do, they fired a gunshot. We had to jump out and repelled those miscreants”, he said.
