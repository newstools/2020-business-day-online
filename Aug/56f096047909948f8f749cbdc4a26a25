 As fears of waste of Rivers funds in Edo elections by Gov Nyesom Wike grows rife, the governor has reacted, assuring that his involvement would not lead to diversion of funds or efforts. Gov Wike told his people that his position as chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Campaign Council for Edo 2020 Governorship Election would not affect the governance and development of the State. He spoke after his routine inspection of on-going projects under the State’s urban renewal programme. The Governor who inspected the Real Madrid Academy, Port Harcourt, Woji Road at the New Government Reservation Area and Rebisi Flyover expressed happiness with the level of work done at the various project sites. “Campaign doesn’t mean that you only go outside. We have our own strategy of campaigning. “We are liaising with the Edo Local Campaign Organization on our winning strategies. So it does not affect governance and the building of infrastructure to develop the state. “The campaign is not distracting me because I am focused on delivering on the promises I made to Rivers people”, he stated. Gov Wike said the August 2020 deadline for the completion of the Real Madrid Academy is sacrosanct. He however stated that government is yet to decide on the September resumption date for academic activities in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Real Madrid Academy is almost ready. So, we believe that with the level of work done so far the August deadline will be achievable,” he said. Gov Wike also expressed happiness that Julius Berger Nigeria PLC would complete Rebisi Flyover by November this year, three months ahead of February, 2021. Gov Wike has only awarded one major contract of N18bn in 2020. The first three flyovers were awarded in 2019 at N21bn.
