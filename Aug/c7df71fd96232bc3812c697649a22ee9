He said the party was in disarray after the 2019 general elections with most members dumping APC for other parties, particularly the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and there has never been cohesion in the party. Moving forward to achieve landmark victory in coming elections, the chairman said it became necessary for interested members to come together, iron out differences, and take strategic steps to win back the state from the PDP. El-Sudi said the issue of funding of the party was top of the meeting agenda. A source privy to the meeting told our correspondent that Ahmed Yusuf, a commissioner representing Taraba State at the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Allocation Commission, said the party is now one whole body again as evident in the calibre of stakeholders at the Abuja parley. The source said members at the meeting included past and present state and National Assembly members including Senator Yusuf Yusuf representing Taraba North senatorial district, university dons, and captains of industry. These big wigs, he said, can stand and win elections for the APC in the state. “Yusuf said all stakeholders in the APC branch of the state are solidly behind the state chairman, Barrister El-Sudi, and we all pass a vote of confidence on the chairman. “We will not be distracted by any rumoured division. We will ensure that we reposition our party ahead of 2023,” the source said.
