Recently, the attention of the Debt Management Office (DMO) has been drawn on the subject of loans obtained from China. As of March 31, 2020, the total borrowing from China stands at $3.121 billion, which accounts for 3.94 percent of Nigeria’s total public debt of $79.303 billion. Moreover, loans from China accounted for 11.28 percent of the external debt stock of $27.67 billion. Hence, China is not a major source of funding for Nigeria. The borrowings from China are concessional loans with interest rates of 2.50%, with the tenor of 20 years and a moratorium of 7 years. Furthermore, the borrowing cost also gets lowered due to the low-interest rate while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over a longer period of time.
