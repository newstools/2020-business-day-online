 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) to apply the brakes in its all-out attacks on the nation’s critical democratic institutions such as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the judiciary. Special Adviser to Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, gave the advice in a note to journalists on Monday in Benin City, the Edo State capital. Osagie said APC’s endless vilification of critical democratic institutions in the country must stop. “Edo people are tired of waking up to torrents of APC’s attacks on these institutions on the pages of newspapers on a daily basis. If it is not INEC today, it will be the judiciary,” Osagie said. “In its latest attack on INEC, APC concocted a story that INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mike Igini, met with Governor Godwin Obaseki in Benin City. Clearly, the APC is taking its frustration, resulting from its low public rating, on everyone and anyone that is not ready to do its bidding,” he said. The governor’s aide declared that “there was no meeting of any kind between Governor Obaseki and Mr. Mike Igini, the INEC REC”. “After a cursory look at the newspapers, one would think that the forthcoming election in Edo State is between APC and the rest of the world, because the party has vilified and misrepresented the judiciary, INEC, the Benin Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (BENCCIMA), royal and notable families in Edo State as well as traditional institutions, like a loose cannon,” he said. He urged the APC’s gubernatorial candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to adopt conventional means in his bid to shore up his battered image, instead of casting aspersions on the nation’s important democratic institutions.
