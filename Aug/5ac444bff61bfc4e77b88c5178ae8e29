Nigeria is also reportedly leading sub-Saharan Africa in peer-to-peer bitcoin trading. BusinessDay also reported that exchanges in the country have seen a spike in bitcoin demand as a result of the continued exchange crisis. Buchi Okoro, CEO of Quidax told BusinessDay that the foreign exchange crisis has made business owners realise that finding a solution could be the difference between their employees receiving an alert at the end of the month or their business shutting down. “We have seen a growing number of businesses realise that cryptocurrencies could make a difference for them. As these businesses are using crypto as a way to hedge against currency risks as well as to make payments to their suppliers and business partners abroad,” Okoro said. “Of course, it also helps that businesses can reduce transaction fees and cut transaction time from 3 days to less than a day.”
