 A former aide to Adams Oshiomhole, former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Andrew Momodu, on Tuesday pledged to support the reelection of Governor Godwin Obaseki with the sum of N5 million. Momodu, who was aide to Oshiomhole during his reign as governor of Edo State, made the pledge on behalf of Anwain Progressives Union (APU) during the state PDP Governorship Campaign at Ward 8 in Anwain Community in Etsako West Local Government Area of the state. He assured the incumbent governor of 6,000 votes from the community. Momodu, who is a political adviser to Obaseki in charge of Edo North Senatorial District, commended the governor for attracting development to the area, particularly the ongoing Agbede-Anwain road construction. Addressing residents of Anwain and Idegun communities, Governor Obaseki promised to reciprocate the gesture of the people by prioritising healthcare, education and agriculture in the second term of his administration if re-elected. Obaseki, who hailed the people of Anwain, said work on the construction of Agbede-Anwain road was suspended by the expatriates over COVID-19 pandemic. He assured that the road would soon be completed. “Since I started this campaign, this is the only place where indigenes give out money to support my campaign. I am very grateful,” he said. Two traditional rulers in the area also endorsed Obaseki’s bid for a second term in office. The two traditional rulers are Mufutairu, the Erama of Idegun Clan and, Zaiki Abulimen Idojerie II of Ewora Clan. According to Zaiki, “He (Obaseki) has done it before and we are still going to do it again. He is the only governor who has remembered us. You do not need to talk much. We are for you. We are ready to follow you,” he added.
