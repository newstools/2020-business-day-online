Oba Saiki, who expressed concern over electoral violence, urged politicians to eschew violence and ensure a peaceful election. “We know that you will win. We have said no to electoral violence. We wish to advise our politicians to shun electoral violence because it does not pay,” he said. He lauded the governor for taking proactive steps in curtailing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Earlier, Governor Obaseki solicited support and prayers to emerge victorious in the election in order to build on numerous achievements. “Your prayers since the past four years, Your Highnesses, brought about radical revolution in my administration. You will not be disappointed. I want to assure you that we will always be there for you,” Obaseki said.
