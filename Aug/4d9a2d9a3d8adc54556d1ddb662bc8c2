 Nigeriaâ€™s currency on Wednesday gained N1.00k on the black market as the dollar was sold at N473 as against N474 sold on Tuesday. The naira appreciation was attributed to low demand by end users amid dollar shortages. However naira was stable at N474 and N381 at the retail bureau and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) official window respectively. The Apex bank on March 26, suspended foreign exchange sales to the Bureau De Change (BDC) operators, until further notice, due to the Covid-19 lockdown as requested by the operators. The suspension notwithstanding, some BDCs are still active in the market.
