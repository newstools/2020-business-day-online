The charts below shows the company has been recording consistent growth in revenue and operating performances over the past five years even amid the ups and downs of country’s macroeconomic environment. Consumer goods firms in Africa’s largest economy are operating in an environment beset by a myriad of challenges such as decrepit infrastructure, harsh regulatory environment and weak consumer spending. In 2016, the sharp drop in oil price of mid-2014 that stoked a severe dollar scarcity created problems for company because they were forced to source foreign currency at the an exorbitant black market rate. That stoked cost of production as material cost spiked due to imported inflations. The country’s economy has been growing sluggishly since it exited a recession in 2017- thanks to the instruction of a foreign exchange regime by the central and rebound in oil price- and inflationary pressure and hike in utility bills have damped consumer sentiments. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 (Q1-2020) slowed to 1.87 percent and the figure for the next quarter (2020) is set to come in negative, despite the series of stimulus packages announced by the authorities aimed at easing the impact of the pandemic on businesses and households. The coronavirus pandemic that paralyzed business activities across the globe has damped the outlook for the Nigerian economy as lockdown imposed by government to curb the spread of the virus disrupted the demand and supply side of the market. Analysts have warned that the economy may enter a technical recession by the third quarter of (Q3) 2020, with a chance of early recovery by fourth quarter (Q4) 2020 or first quarter (Q1)2021. Analysts at sundry research house expect Northern Nigeria Flour Mills and peer rivals to stay immune to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or restrictions, largely because their major product portfolios (Food, Sugar and Agro-Allied) which are concentrated on essential items. Also, they expect that the recent reversal of the 5.0 percent increase in duties on raw Sugar by the federal government in July 2020 would further spur growth in the Sugar segments even as the benefits from border closure remain apparent across the segments. However, industry players with low portfolio concentration in products that are considered essential (food, beverages, agro-allied and home & personal care) could capitulate to COVID-19 crisis.
