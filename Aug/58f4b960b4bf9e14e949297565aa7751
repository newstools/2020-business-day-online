 Ahead of the forthcoming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has ordered Commissioners of Police in the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to immediately initiate appropriate actions to identify, isolate, disarm, arrest and prosecute any individual(s) or group(s) in possession of prohibited firearms. According to a statement issued on Sunday by the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba (DCP), this has become necessary to boost the efforts by the Police High Command to curb the proliferation of prohibited firearms in the country, which politicians are allegedly stockpiling to cause mayhem in the two states. “The directive has become necessary against the backdrop of the deliberate arming and movement of political thugs and other criminal elements across the country. In addition, the directive is targeted at addressing the proliferation and unlawful possession of prohibited firearms in the country which is contrary to the provisions of Chapter F.28 LFN 2004 of the Firearms Act,” the statement said. In a similar vein, Commissioners of Police in all the states of the federation and the FCT have been directed to immediately convene an enlightenment meeting of all vigilante groups and quasi security outfits spread across the country in order to ensure that their activities are in conformity with the extant laws guiding their establishment and operations. The IGP, while observing that several civil groups – vigilantes, quasi states and regional security outfits – under various guises are arming themselves with prohibited firearms and weapons in contravention of the provisions of the Firearms Act, noted that the trend if unchecked would pose serious threat to national security. The IGP enjoined citizens to cooperate with the police in the enforcement of this order as it is aimed at ensuring safety of lives and property in the country.
