According to the statement, “Today, because of the mindboggling corruption in our public and political space, incorruptibility has become the top virtue we look for in leadership. But the political school of thought that Fasanmi successfully practised does not even rate incorruptibility as a strong virtue – it is a given. “For the disciples of this school of thought, the top virtue of a politician is the ability to implement policies that lift millions out of poverty and create an egalitarian society where there is freedom for all to pursue their ambitions and abundance of life’s good things.”
