 Godwin Obaseki, Edo State Governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), recently unveiled plans to raise a new generation of farmers who will set the pace for agricultural revolution in the state. Obaseki made the commitment during an on-the-spot assessment of Sobe Farms in Owan West Local Government Area of the state, as part of activities for his re-election campaign rally. He admitted that despite the initial hitches experienced at the beginning of the state’s agripreneur programme, remarkable progress has been recorded in food production with the introduction of advanced technology by the government. “With the experience they have gathered, you can see these agripreneurs doing things on their own. We are creating a generation of farmers who we are supporting. All of these farms were ploughed by us. “We have done about six of such farms in other senatorial districts of the state. We have similar farms in Usugbenu and Ugboha (Edo Central); Warrake and Agbede rice farms in Agenebode (Edo North) and in Akoko-Edo where there is a similar project. “This is the third time we are cultivating these farms. The last time we came was in 2018. We suffered some losses. In 2019, we did much better. “In 2020, you can see that they are starting much earlier. They are trying to catch up with the rains. You can see the way they are spraying the farm so that they can get the required yield.” “They have planted maize now and after the wet season, they will plant soya beans,” he added. James Edojah, a worker in the farm, was on ground during the governor’s visit to the farm which was established by the government a few years ago.
