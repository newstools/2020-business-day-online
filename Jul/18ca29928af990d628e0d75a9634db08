 The defection of the former speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) came as a surprise to political watchers. Recall that Dogara who represented Bogoro/DassTafawa Balewa federal constituency of Bauchi State in the House of Representatives, had defected to the PDP alongside former Senate president, Bukola Saraki and incumbent Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal in 2018. He alongside Saraki fell out with the leadership of the APC over their controversial emergence as leaders in the eight National Assembly, a move that was against the interest of the party. Throughout the four years, the duo did not have a cordial working relationship with the Buhari-led executive, culminating in the ruling party working assiduously so that Saraki and other lawmakers who defected to the PDP did not return as federal lawmakers after the 2019 election. Observers say Dogaraâ€™s decision to dump the PDP may not be a surprise considering that not much has been heard about him in the party lately.
