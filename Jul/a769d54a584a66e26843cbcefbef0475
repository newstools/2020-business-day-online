 The Senate on Tuesday mandated its Committee on Foreign Affairs to begin screening of John U. Usanga (Akwa Ibom); and Air Commodore Peter Ndabake Gana (Rtd.) (Niger) as Non-Career Ambassadors. The Committee is tasked to submit the screening report to the Senate, within two weeks. Also, the Senate referred the nomination of Professor Umar Danbatta for appointment as Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to the Senate Committee on Communications. Similarly, confirmation of Barrister Ben Umeano (Anambra – South East); Hon. Ehiozuwa Johnson Agbonayinma (Edo – South South); and Olayinka Babatunde Balogun (Ogun – South West) as Members of the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) was also handed to the Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions. Recall that the Senate had a week ago received a request from President Muhammadu Buhari for the replacement and confirmation of two non-career Ambassadors-designate. The request was contained in a letter read during plenary by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. The President sought to replace the earlier nomination of Mr. Oboro Effiong Akpabio and Brigadier General Bwala Yusuf Bukar from Akwa-Ibom and Borno State, respectively. The letter reads: “In accordance to Section 171(1)(2)(c) and subsection (4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended, I have the honour to forward for confirmation by the Senate, the appointment of Mr. John J. Usanga and Air Commodore Peter Anda Bakiya Gana (rtd) from Akwa-Ibom and Niger State respectively, as non-career Ambassadors-designate. “The Senate is kindly requested to recall my earlier submission of Mr. Oboro Effiong Akpabio and Brigadier General Bwala Yusuf Bukar from Akwa-Ibom and Borno State respectively, vide letter dated 17th June 2020, I substitute Mr. Oboro Effiong Akpabio with Mr. John J.
