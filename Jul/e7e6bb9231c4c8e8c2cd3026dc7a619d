The FGN total debt service cost for the external obligations have added up to $473 million in 1Q20, an increase of $116 million as compared to the prior period. Despite the domestic lockdown, adversely affected oil prices and the production restraints, debt servicing costs are perceived to be manageable. It should be noted that average borrowing costs from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and Exim Bank of China were 1.1 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively. On the other hand, FGN’s average borrowing costs stood at 7.5 percent. Furthermore, if the foreign exchange risk is not considered, for the time being, the external debt was less costly as compared to domestic debt; even factoring in the decline in the NT-Bills and FGN Bond rates, the analysts said.
