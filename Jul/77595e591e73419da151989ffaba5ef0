The Benin monarch, in a statement signed by the secretary of the Benin Traditional Council, Frank Irabor, reiterated that the Benin throne is non-partisan. “The Benin Traditional Council wishes to state that His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin, warmly welcomed the august visitors, led by His Excellency, Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo State. “The meeting was cordial. During the meeting, His Royal Majesty recalled the warm reception accorded him by governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto state when the Omo N’Oba paid a thank you visit to those states. The courtesy visit of the esteemed august visitors to the Omo N’Oba ended well. “We were therefore surprised to hear that there was an incident outside the palace, directly in front of Oredo Local Government Secretariat,” he said. While expressing dismay over the disorderly conduct of the youths, he advised all political parties and their members not to turn Edo state into a war zone because of their gubernatorial ambition. The Oba, who noted that he is committed to peace and prosperity, called on well-meaning indigenes of Edo state to join the palace in praying for a peaceful governorship election.
