 Hackers took over the accounts of prominent individuals and organisations on Twitter promising a cryptocurrency giveaway of 5000 BTC ($45,889,950) “to the community”. The affected individuals include  Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Ripple, Tron’s Justin Sun, Bitcoin, Cash App, Coindesk, and Litecoin’s Charlie Lee. The hackers’ messages sent within minutes of each other asked readers to claim their rewards from an inserted link associated with “Crypto For Health”. In one of the tweets sent from the account of Elon Musk, the hackers asked for Bitcoin and promised to “double all payments” sent to an address. A tweet sent from Elon Musk’s account on Wednesday asked for Bitcoin and promised to “double all payments” sent to an address. “Everyone is asking me to give back, and now is the time,” the tweet said. “You send $1,000, I send you back $2,000.” The Musk’s account sent three Bitcoin tweets from a Twitter web account and a reply to Bill Gates which were promptly deleted.  The bitcoin address linked in the tweets posted to Gates’s and Musk’s accounts was quickly inundated with more than 255 transactions, totaling more than $100,000. Twitter has admitted that it is aware of ‘security incidents’ impacting accounts and is ‘taking steps to fix it’.
