 President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has charged the Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to engage relevant stakeholders with a view to reforming Nigeria’s Electoral process. Lawan gave the charge in his remark after referring the confirmation of the nomination of Chukwuemeka Chukwu for appointment as a Resident Electoral Commissioner to the INEC Committee. According to Lawan, the reform of the country’s electoral process by the National Assembly must be carried out with a view to meeting the expectations of Nigerians. “We must ensure that we work so hard and assiduously on the electoral reforms. This is one way of ensuring that we collect all the different submissions from different stakeholders. “Our Committee on INEC together with major stakeholders should start working on this as quickly as possible, to ensure that we are able to meet the expectations of Nigerians regarding electoral reforms,” Lawan said. The Senate President also gave the Committee four weeks to submit its report on the appointment of Dr. Chukwuemeka Chukwu as a Resident Electoral Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
