Commenting on the boycott of the council election by the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ishaku said that the participation in the council election was optional and the party has its rights not to participate. The governor, who has been away from his home town Takum since his reelection as governor of the state in 2019, expressed concern over the communal crisis that have ravaged the region in the recent times. He said the government and all the security agencies have been working round the clock to bring lasting solution to the crisis. “I have often told my people to give me peace and I will give them development because when there is no peace there won’t be any meaningful development,” he said.
