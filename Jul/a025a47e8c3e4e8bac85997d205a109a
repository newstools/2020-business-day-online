 Nigeria’s stock market routed to the south on Thursday July 2 reconfirming our earlier report that investors should still approach the market with caution as odds favour the bears in early part of this second-half (H2). Sell pressure on stocks like Unilever Nigeria Plc, GTBank Plc, Flourmills Nigeria Plc, Zenith Bank Plc and Cadbury Nigeria Plc contributed to the record capital depreciation in excess of N115billion. The market’s negative return year-to-date (ytd) stood high at -9.19percent; this month it’s down by -0.43 percent; while it has dipped by -1.83 percent this week. The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All Share Index (ASI) decreased by 0.90 percent or 220.65 points as the close of ongoing remote trading session to 24,374.40 points from preceding day high of 24,595.05 points.

Despite a positive open to the H2, investors should still keep an eye on economic data that will indicate the shape of economic recovery. Oil prices rose on Thursday as a sharp drop in oil stockpiles outweighed concerns that a spike in US coronavirus infections and revived lockdown measures in California could stall a recovery in fuel demand.
