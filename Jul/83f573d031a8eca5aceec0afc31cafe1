 The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has returned market operations from three days a week to all 7 days in the week from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm with effect from Thursday, as part of measures to decongest the markets in the FCT and further check the spread of COVID-19. Consequently, the Abuja Market Management Limited and various market associations will continue to carry out sensitization activities to enlighten market users on COVID-19 and the necessity of obeying all extant health and safety protocols. Access to the markets and operations within the markets will only be permitted with the wearing of facial coverings and adherence to all extant health and safety guidelines inclusive of handwashing and maintenance of physical distancing. However, failure by the Coalition of FCT Market Chairmen and Secretaries to fully implement these guidelines, the FCTA will be compelled to withdraw this extension. These were the resolutions reached the virtual meeting between members of the FCT COVID-19 Response Team, senior members of the FCT Administration, and members of the Coalition of FCT Market Chairmen and Secretaries led by its Chairman Raphael Okorie. At the meeting Chaired by the Minister of FCT,Â  Muhammad Bello, deliberated on the request by the Coalition of FCT Market Chairmen and Secretaries for the operational days of FCT markets to be extended to all 7 days of the week as against the 3 days weekly that is currently in effect.
