 The All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign for the September 19 Edo Governorship election would be a subject of irony over workers’ welfare. This is as two members of the APC Campaign Council and Governors, Hope Uzodinma and Yahaya are having issues with payment of workers’ salaries while Governor Godwin Obaseki, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate which they campaign against has paid Edo workers up to date. The 49-member APC Edo Governorship Election Campaign Council chaired by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has the Imo State Governor, Uzodinma as Vice Chairman with the Kogi State farm, Bello as a member. The Campaign Council which would be inaugurated on Monday by the Mai-Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee is to principally sell the candidature of the party’s flagbearer, Osagie Ize-Iyamu to the people of Edo State.
