 The Action Democratic Party (ADP) has refuted claims by the Edo State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) that ADP structures in the state has collapsed and fused into the PDP, urging Nigerians to disregard the misinformation. In a statement to journalists Wednesday by the ADP National Publicity Secretary, Adeoye Adelaja faulted the PDP claim while describing it as baseless and unfounded. Adelaja further said that the party was fully on ground in Edo State and was working actively to participate in the gubernatorial election, adding that those individuals claiming to have defected to the PDP were not members of the party. “ADP is participating fully in the upcoming election in Edo State, and has not at any time, entered into any kind of merger, coalition or arrangement with the PDP or any other political party. “Those parading themselves as members of our great party in the state, claiming to have defected with others, have no record on our membership list, and as such cannot be said to be our members. “ADP further warns that anybody impersonating and fraudulently using the name of our great party ADP, to swindle people will be handed over to the law enforcement agencies, for prosecution in the court of law,” the party said. He further cautioned and alerted the public not to fall for the PDP’s antics, stressing that the party was sure of victory in the election. “In the interest of the public, it is important to make this clarification, for people to disregard the machinations of political jobbers, who are always moving from one party to the other at every election cycle. “ADP is certain of victory in the poll and have assured its members across the country and in the Diaspora that there is no cause for alarm,” he added.
