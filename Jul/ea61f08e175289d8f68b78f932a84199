 The Ondo State governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has emerged the candidate of the All Progressives Congress for the October 10 governorship election in the state with 2,458 votes. Governor Akeredolu won in all the 18 local government areas of the state, defeating all the other contestants with a landslide. A breakdown of the results shows that Akeredolu, the incumbent governor, got 2,458 votes, followed by Olusola Oke with 262 votes. Isaac Kekemeke got 19 votes, Olusola Iji got nine votes, Olayide Adelami and Nathaniel Adojutelegan got four votes each, Jumoke Anifowoshe got two votes, Ifeoluwa Oyedele and Awodeyi Akinseyinwa got one vote each, while the trio of Olusegun Abraham, Bukola Adetula and Jimi Odimayo got no votes at all. Recall that three out of the 12 governorship aspirants – Jimi Odimayo, Ifeoluwa Oyedele and Segun Abraham – had withdrawn from the APC primary election before the commencement of the primaries, stepping down for the incumbent Governor Akeredolu. Announcing the results at the end of the exercise which lasted for several hours, chairman of the governorship primary election committee who is also the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, said the exercise was conducted and concluded freely, fairly and transparently. Bello said that the registered voters were 3,016; total votes cast were 2,793; number of valid votes were 2,760; and invalid votes were 33. “Akeredolu, having scored the highest scores, is hereby declared winner,” Bello said.
