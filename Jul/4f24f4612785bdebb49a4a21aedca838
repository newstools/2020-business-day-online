 The Supreme Court Thursday validated the virtual court sitting, saying that it was constitutional while it was a decision of the State Chief Judge on how they wish to operate proceedings in their states. A 7- man panel of the apex Court led by Justice Olabode Rhodes-vivour gave the submission during the hearing of separate suits filed by the Attorneys General of Lagos and Ekiti States on the adoption of remote hearings by judges in their states. The panel ruled that virtual court sittings are presumed to be valid and not to be declared unconstitutional. Members of the panel dismissed the fear said to be entertained by many judges as to the constitutionality of remote hearings in the country. They maintained that the Chief Judges of the states that had issued practice directions to provide for virtual sitting when convenient had the duty to enforce the directive. The panel described the suits of both the Lagos and Ekiti statesâ€™ AGS as speculative as the suits did not disclose how virtual proceedings had injured the interest or right of anyone. The Lagos State AG, Moyosore Onigbanjo ( SAN), and that of Ekiti State, Olawale Fapohunda, then withdrew the suits after members of the apex Court panel described the suits academic and speculative. In striking out the suit, Justice Rhodes-vivour held that it was not unconstitutional. Lagos State had filed the suit to challenge the power of the National Assembly to amend Section 274 of the constitution which seeks including virtual proceedings in the Constitution. Ekiti State had urged the court to make an affirmative decision on the issue to remove the speculations and uncertainties being entertained about it by judges.
