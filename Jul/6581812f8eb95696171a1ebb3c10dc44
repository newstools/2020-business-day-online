 The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has stated in unequivocal terms that it did not sponsor the protest against Gani Audu, running mate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate in the forthcoming governorship election in the state. The PDP, in a statement by Chris Osa Nehikhare, its spokesperson in Edo State, said the party had no hand in the protest. People of Agbede in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State had woken up on Sunday to a protest against Gani Audu, one of their sons and running mate of the APC gubernatorial candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and the APC had, days after the widely reported incident, accused the PDP of sponsoring the protest. “We wish to state that the PDP did not sponsor the protest. For emphasis, we don’t sponsor protests. The claim by APC that the protest was sponsored by our party, the PDP, is a figment of their imagination,” PDP said. “It is established fact that Gani Audu performed woefully as local government chairman, amongst other allegations levelled against him by his kinsmen. Therefore, the youths must be commended for the courage they displayed in expressing their discontent over Audu’s failings and betrayal of the trust reposed in him by his people who elected him to deliver the dividends of democracy,” it said in the statement. The party said the actions of the youths further give insight into what awaits non-performing elected officials in the near future. “Democracy must put food on the table of the people, fix weak infrastructure, provide quality education and improved health care, amongst others, as Governor Godwin Obaseki has diligently done in the last three years and seven months,” PDP said. “Elected and unelected officials alike must brace up to provide purposive leadership and this should be addressed by the sinking APC in order to avert the treatment meted on Gani Audu in Agbede in future,” it said.
