The party said Fayose, over the years, had demonstrated an uncommon commitment and zeal towards the unity, stability and development of Nigeria. The PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that the former governor had also been fighting for the rights, liberty and welfare of the common man, in line with the manifesto and ideals of the party. “Unarguably, Chief Fayose is a fearless and very forthright leader whose outspokenness for justice, equality and fairness, particularly for the downtrodden, clearly demonstrates his belief in putting the good and welfare of others above personal interests; the very reason he is so loved across our nation. “Indeed, Osokomole’s (Fayose’s) sense of duty, particularly during his tenure as governor of Ekiti state, where his exceptional transparency, accessibility, humility in service and love for his people propelled him to deliver an unprecedented development of Ekiti state in all sectors of life, during which the state experienced its best and most productive years. “The PDP family therefore celebrates this rare patriot and prays God to grant him many more years ahead to continue in his statesmanship and selfless service to our nation, Nigeria and humanity at large.”
