 There was great jubilation in Jalingo, the Taraba State capital, on Sunday as the commissioner for water resources and environment, Yusufu Nya Akirikwen, made the list of the 72 lawyers who were nominated to the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN). Akirikwen was one of the 72 lawyers named by the Legal Practitioners Privilege Committee (LPPC) on Friday. A total of 137 lawyers were shortlisted for the rank in 2020 — with 116 advocate applicants and 21 academic applicants. Of the 137 candidates shortlisted, 72 were successful, while 60 did not make the list. Akirikwen was shortlisted as one of those who made remarkable achievements in the legal profession in Nigeria and beyond. Reacting, Garba Samson Ajiya, member representing Takum 1 in the Taraba State House of Assembly, enjoined Akirikwen to use his new office in the legal world to uphold justice and tranquillity in the nation and his home state of Taraba. Tanko Yusuf described Akirikwen’s nomination to the rank of SAN as the right step in the right direction. He advised the newly nominated SAN to bring his wealth of experience to sanitise the Nigeria judicial system for optimal performance. A cross section of the people who spoke to BusinessDay in Jalingo advised Akirikwen to see himself as an advocate of Nigeria and not of any tribe, religion or section of the country.
