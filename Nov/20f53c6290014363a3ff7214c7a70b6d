 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says the visit by governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to former President Goodluck Jonathan has further affirmed that Nigeria, as a nation, is better under the PDP. The opposition party said it was an apology by the APC for the lies and other irresponsible acts they deployed to grab power in 2015. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Sunday, also said it also “indicates that the APC, in 2015, only created artificial symbols of misgovernance, corruption and other alleged misgivings just to discredit our party and grab the levers of power to achieve their selfish desires” He added, “It is evident that the Jonathan administration succeeded in office basically because our party understands the nuances of our nation, which we translated into people-oriented polices and programmes, in line with the manifesto of our party, to make life comfortable for Nigerians. “This visit to Jonathan by the APC governors is a direct acceptance of the successes recorded by our party in building a strong nation with a virile economy that was rated as one of the fastest growing economies of the world. “The visit is therefore a subtle step by APC governors into the corridors of the PDP in agreement that our party holds the solution to the myriads of problems brought to our nation by their APC and President Muhammadu Buhari. “The PDP therefore receives the visit by APC governors as an apology by the APC to our party and Nigerians over the lies, beguilements and other irresponsible allegations deployed by the APC to grab power, only to lead our nation on a journey to nowhere.” The PDP cautioned Nigerians to be watchful of the antics of the APC that had failed in governance and the management of its own affairs. “For us in the PDP, the unity, stability, progress and development of our dear nation remain paramount and as such, we will not allow the failed APC and its pranksters, who have betrayed the trust of Nigerians, to mislead them once again,” the statement said.
