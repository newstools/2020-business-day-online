 The Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, on Wednesday declared that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is not in anyway disturbed with the exit of the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi. In a statement by his Media Adviser, Uchenna Awom in Abuja, Abaribe said the party had before now adjusted its mind to the fact that Umahi was already in the All Progressive Congress (APC) in spirit before his formal announcement on Tuesday. Accordingly, the PDP he said is Unfazed and will surely not be affected negatively or it’s membership eroded, neither will the fortunes of APC be enhanced with Umahi’s joining of the party. The Minority Leader also faulted Umahi’s reasons of injustice and lack of fairness as why he left the party. “It is not true and very unfortunate for the governor to characterise the PDP in such light. Examples are legion, which shows that our dear party has reciprocated severally the support of the South East, meaning that the party is not taking the support of Ndi-Igbo for granted. “It is inconceivable to perceive the position of Presidential photographer, which Ndi-Igbo currently occupies in the villa as fairness”, Abaribe said.
