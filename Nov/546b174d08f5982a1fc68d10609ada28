 The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has constituted a state caretaker committee to pilot the affairs of the party in Ebonyi State. This followed Tuesday night dissolution of the State Executive Committee of the party by the NWC. The dissolution might not be unconnected with the Tuesday exit of the Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, from the party. According to a statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the seven-member caretaker committee is chaired by Fred Udeogu with Luke Nkwegu, a lawyer, as secretary.
