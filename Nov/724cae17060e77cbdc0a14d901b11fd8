 Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has described the late first Civilian governor of Kadun state, Balarabe Musa, as a patriot, who contributed immensely to democracy and Nigeria’s political evolution. The former President, who mourned the passage of Musa to the great beyond on early hours of Wednesday, noted that the late former governor of Kaduna, despite being an untiring critic of his People’s Democratic Party (PDP)-led Nigeria Federal Government between 1999 and 2007, remained a patriot until he died. While expressing a deep shock over the death of Musa through a press release signed by Kehinde Akinyemi, his Special Assistant on Media in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital on Wednesday, Obasanjo said the late former governor of Kaduna state had unwavering belief in a greater Nigeria. BusinessDay reports that the late politician emerged the first civilian Governor of Kaduna State on the platform of the moribund National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in 1979 and re-affirmed himself one of Nigeria’s most articulate governors at the time. He said: “He brought renewed activism, verve and resourcefulness to bear on the nation’s polity. And, he accordingly gave the best of his remarkable talent and ability in pursuit of this goal. “Despite his later impeachment as the Governor of Kaduna state in 1981, he contested an elective office for the People’s Redemption Party (PRP) where he ran as Presidential Candidate in the 2003 election which unfortunately he lost. “The late Balarabe Musa will be remembered for his invaluable contribution to Nigeria’s political evolution. “He brought renewed activism, verve and resourcefulness to bear on the nation’s polity.
