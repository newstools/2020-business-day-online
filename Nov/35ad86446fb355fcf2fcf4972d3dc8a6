 The Naija Farmer Reality TV show, a brainchild of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, was aimed at lifting over 20 million youths out of poverty in the next decade, pursuant to President Muhammadu Buhari’s pledged to lift Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years. The initiative, which will commence officially on November 29, 2020, on Channel 140 of Startimes Bouquet, will also create over one million agribusiness owners within 10 years. Ezeaja Ikemefuna, the chief information officer in the ministry, explained that the ministry, in collaboration with Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), Startimes, Radio, Television and Theatre Workers Union of Nigeria (RATTAWU) and other stakeholders, would commence the reality show called “NAIJA FARMER’. Ikemefuna said the Naija Farmer Reality show was a youth empowerment project targeted principally at transforming unemployed Nigerian youths into employers of labour. He noted that all participants would receive Seed Capital from Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and other financial institutions to establish Smallholder Agribusiness after the extensive training on television, adding that beneficiaries would also become celebrities and supermodels for upcoming farmers and Nigerian youths. The maiden edition of the Naija Farmer reality show would include 21 Housemates selected from the six geopolitical zones of the country at a located Naija Farmer House in Abuja. It would be a 24-hour reality show on Channel 140 of Startimes Bouquet already being test run.
