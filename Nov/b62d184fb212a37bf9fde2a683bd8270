 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it is deeply grieved by the death of former Governor of old Kaduna State, Balarabe Musa. The party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the deceased as an elder statesman and outstanding democrat. It described his death as a huge national loss “given his steadfastness, patriotic contributions and zeal in fighting for the unity, stability and development of our nation.” The statement read, “Alhaji Musa was a forthright leader, an embodiment of ideals, who spent better part of his life championing the entrenchment of justice, equity, fairness and rule of law in every sector of our national life, despite the challenges he faced. “Our party commiserates with the Balarabe Musa family, the government and people of Kaduna state, as well as his friends and associates even as we pray that the Almighty God grants eternal repose to his soul and fortitude to the family and the nation at large, to bear this irreparable loss.”
