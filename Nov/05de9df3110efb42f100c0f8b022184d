 The All Progressives Congress (APC) has given Governor Dave Umahi who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to its fold, the party’s structure in the State. This is as the Mai-Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) dissolved the Party’s Ebonyi State Working Committee. The party said its decision is based on the refusal of factions to withdraw court cases as directed by the 8th resumed meeting of the APC National Executive Committee (NEC) and submit to internal party resolution mechanisms initiated by the CECPC but the action appears as a move to give Umahi party’s structure as its new leader in Ebonyi. Yekini Nabena, Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC in a statement Wednesday night said a 15-member Caretaker Committee has subsequently been appointed by the APC CECPC to manage the Party’s affairs and carry out the planned membership registration, update, and revalidation exercise in Ebonyi State. According to the statement, the Ebonyi APC Caretaker Committee has Stanley Okoro – Chairman, John Nwankata – Vice Chairman (North), Peter Nworie Ndubuisi – Vice Chairman (Central), Ozoemena Njoku – Vice Chairman (South), Charles Ofoke – Secretary, Ogbonnaya Igboke – Organising Secretary and Chidi Ogbuatu – Publicity Secretary. Others are, Ikaa, Ikaa Ukeni – Legal Adviser, Paulinus Ali (Zomo) – Treasurer, Joseph Ozibo – Financial Secretary, Ogochukwu Elem – Youth Leader, Odo Juliet – Women Leader, Ogbonna Nshii – Auditor, Adum Basil –Physically Challenged and Francis Nweze – Welfare Secretary. “As the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC repositions our great party, we urge our supporters, members, and leaders in Ebonyi state and other chapters to support and work towards the achievement of the peace and reconciliation mandate of the CECPC”, the statement added.
